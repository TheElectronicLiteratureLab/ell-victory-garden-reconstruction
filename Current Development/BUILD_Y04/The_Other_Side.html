<h1>The Other Side</h1>



<p>The Mother of Battles has just started in the Gulf.  The traitors began their attack at 2:30 a.m. on the night of January 16-17.  The cowards attacked us with treachery.  Satan Bush and criminal Zionism have committed their crimes.  The Mother of Battles has started between the forces of evil and justice.  Justice will win with the help of God.  ... The courageous Iraqis, who carry the torch of Islam, will emerge victorious.  The thrones of the traitors will soon fall when the will of the Satan of the White House breaks.  Palestine and the Golan Heights will be liberated.  Mecca will be liberated.  The Occupied Territories will be liberated.</p>

                           <p>â€” From Saddam Hussein's radio address, morning of January 17</p>
