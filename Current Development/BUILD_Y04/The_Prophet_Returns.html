<h1>The Prophet Returns</h1>

<p>The man at the water's edge was evidently ambidextrous, or at least capable of managing two things at once.  While his left hand was engaged (along with other parts of his anatomy) in symbolic demonstration, he used his right to hoist up a battery-powered megaphone and make this little speech.</p>

<p><em>PEOPLES OF TARA.  THE ONE AND ONLY GOD HAS GIVEN YOU THIS  LOVELY JEWEL YET YOU WOULD SEE IT TURNED INTO A PUBLIC SEWER â€” JUST AS EVEN NOW YOUR INFIDEL ARMIES VIOLATE THE PURITY OF  THE HOLY DESERT.  </p>

<p>THE PROPHET UQBARI HAS COME TO SHOW YOU THE SHAME OF YOUR OFFENSE.   BEHOLD, I MAKE WATER IN YOUR POOL.  MAY IT SHOW YOU THE WAY TO CLEANLINESS.  PEACE BE UPON YOU.</p>

</em><p>And having uttered these words the prophet buttoned up, dropped his megaphone, and leapt into the bushes.</p>
