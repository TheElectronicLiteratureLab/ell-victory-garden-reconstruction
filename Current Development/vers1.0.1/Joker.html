<h1>Joker</h1>

<p>Things might not have gone much further had tonight's activity been entirely a Sigma Omega fraternity joint.  But <a href="Here_They_Come.html">as previously noted</a> there was a joker in the deck, or to be accurate, at the wheel of the Rainbow Riders tour bus, who after driving around the block a few times in confusion, finally managed to back onto Thea Agnew's front lawn.  The marchers pulled up short and collected quickly around this new point of interest.</p>

<p><em>"Unholy</em> shit," Veronica said when she saw who was extricating himself from the driver's seat.</p>

<p>
	"Evening all," Billy Van Saxgutter announced, squaring up his string tie and doffing the Stetson.  "Does one of you ladies happen to be Professor Dorothea Agnew?"
</p>

<p>"Billy Van," Veronica called out to him.  "Be cool for shit's sake."</p>

<p>The jovial prankster squinted in her direction.  "Is it that little Runnin' Bird, there?"</p>
