<h1>A Close One</h1>

<p>They pulled out to pass a jeep filled with coeds and nearly lost it as all the brothers pressed up to the starboard windows and the poor old bus canted over nearly past recovery.</p>

<p>"Yee Ha, as they say," Billy Van whooped, understeering violently as they boltered into a curve.  He was peering curiously out the port side windows.  "Wait a minute."  He jammed on the brakes, which like everything else associated with the Rainbow Riders leaned decidedly left, fishtaiing the bus across its lane.  Brothers and beercans went flying toward the windshield, but there were no broken bones. As yet. The jeep skidded by on the shoulder, its occupants showing the collective finger.</p>
