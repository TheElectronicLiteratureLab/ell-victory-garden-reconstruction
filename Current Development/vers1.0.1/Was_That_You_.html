<p>Billy Van inspected his left bootheel.  "You see, Ms. Runbird," he related, "I was over to the Just Say No a little earlier in the evening, and found the place in quite a state.  Folks related some real strange shit happening just before I came on scene."</p>

<p>"It's that sort of town," Veronica reminded him.  "Keep Tara terrific."</p>

<p>"What I did hear," Billy Van continued, "was that some young lady very much like yourself went, I believe the term is <em>loco</em>, up in the place. Word was she slapped a few folks around and smashed the bar up pretty good."</p>

<p>Thea looked at Veronica and blinked.  "Say what?"</p>
