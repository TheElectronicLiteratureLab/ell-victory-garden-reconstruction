<a class="textlink"  href="Drawing_Room.html"><strong>ANIMATED</strong></a> <strong>MOST DELIGHTFUL</strong><br>
In elder days this was called a Triumph<br>
Time and violence Inevitable outcomes<br>
don't worry son just follow that Arrow and<br>
wheeze out the thing she wanted <br>
No visionary, no mystic, no women who said they weren't sure they ought to go<br>
I explained it all to them, I<br>
YOU KNOW THAT ABOUT ME<br>
"Fuck," Dan Rather was saying <br>
something sanctimonious <br>
like to think you did as well<br>
What makes you think of me as paranoid<br>
don't worry <br>
Just for the sake of inquiry, do I really know you?<br>
