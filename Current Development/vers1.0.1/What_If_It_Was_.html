<h1>What If It Was?</h1>

<p>Veronica stared up the evil clown's left nostril.  "And what's it to you?"</p>

<p>Billy Van scratched a floppy earlobe, pondering implications.  "Look see, Runbird, I always did regard you as having more cojones than half the so-called bad dudes in this town."</p>

<p>"I'm touched," Veronica said.  "But the SWAT team's overdue.  Make your point if you have one."</p>

<p>The mayhematician pulled himself up and straightened his single-starred belt buckle.  "Doctor Agnew," he told Thea, "the fellas here and I don't particularly approve of your trying to stomp on Western Civilization and our American way of doing.  And I allow as we might have showed here tonight to make a show of that displeasure.  But owing to respect for our young friend over there, I am gonna advise my associates to act like they were gentlemen." </p>
<p>
Thea snorted.  Veronica kept on staring lasers.
