<h1>Say, Miss...</h1>

<p>"Aw shit," Vance objected, extricating himself from a pile of bodies under the dashboard.  "Asking directions.  Not my thing.  You do it."</p>

<p>Billy Van called him six kinds of varmint but jammed the bus back into gear, swung around and blasted back eastward in the westbound lane of Lago Vista.  He crunched to a halt opposite the pedestrian, leaned out and inclined his hatbrim.</p>

<p>"Evening, miss."</p>

<p>
	Leroy Sieger stared at this apppearance in the night, making the mental note <em>oh shit only </em>half<em> a shroom next time</em>.  He was looking at an ancient short-haul bus standing wrongway round in the middle of the road.  It was painted in a colorful way that owed more to Matt Groening than R. Crumb.  The driver was this sinister-looking guy in a string tie and hornrimmed glasses whose face (as Leroy's brain would have it just now) was that of a sea lion.  Or a sea horse?  See Threepio?  Fucking mushrooms.  The fellow was squinting at Leroy in plain vexation.
