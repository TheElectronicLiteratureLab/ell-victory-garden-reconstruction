<h1>Unity Candidate</h1>

<p><em>And who would this unity candidate be? </em></p>

<p><em>Well...  I warn you, it's obviously someone neither of us would have chosen.  Someone we'd both regard as unsuitable, though not necessarily because of his views.  To be frank, Tate's trying to play games here.</p>

</em><p>As if you're not.</p>

<p><em>So who is it?</p>

<p>Boris Urquhart.</em>  </p>
