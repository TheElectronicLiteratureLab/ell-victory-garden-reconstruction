<h1>Take Off</h1>

<p>He looked back again, saw Madden still behind him.  Reflex reaction.  <em>U must flee.</em></p>

<p>Urquhart coaxed the gearshift into first, wound the engine up and popped the clutch.  The rear tires spun and then took hold, and the car bolted toward the next light, which was still a fresh red.  Urquhart shifted up, standing on the gas.  He was thinking linear thoughts.  He denied the possibility of obstruction.  No one would get in his way.  Shift up to third.</p>

<p>Behind him Madden jerked his car around the pickup, which had pulled over for a left turn.  He was trying to think clearly about the situation: what to do?  He could break off the chase now, which would halve the chances of a crash and keep his own ass intact.  He could call just call in the locals and wash his hands of this nutcase.  On the other hand, there was no telling what Urquhart was up to.  Right now it was just reckless driving, but what next?  Madden checked the intersection as carefully as he could and charged through.</p>
