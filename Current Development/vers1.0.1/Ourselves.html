<h1>Ourselves</h1>

<p>"We haven't been ourselves lately," Urquhart tried to explain.  "Or rather, we have."  Jude wasn't following.  Maybe it was the contradictions.  </p>

<p>"What it is," he tried again, "is this swarming sensation, you see."  He turned his chair back into the room and looked vaguely in her direction, momentarily blinded by the change of light.</p>

<p>"Swarming sensation?  Maybe it's just, like, your inner ear," Jude suggested.</p>

<p>Urquhart laughed.  "You could say that."  He went quiet again, listening with that inner ear.  The nub of his cigar glowed steadily.  "U. likes to think of himself as a crossover," he continued at last, "as much humanist as scientist.  So for the last ten years or so he's been sucking up that postmodern theory.  This may have been the beginning."</p>

<p>"Fair guess," Jude opined.</p>
