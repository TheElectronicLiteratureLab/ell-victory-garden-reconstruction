<h1>Fancy This</h1>

<p>Billy Van crossed meaty arms over his chest and slouched against the nose of the Rainbow Bus.  "Howdy there, Little Runbird.  I did not know that you and the Professor were, might I say, closely acquainted."  Putting on a deeply regrettable leer.</p>

<p>"Go lick an armadillo," Veronica told him.</p>

<p>Billy Van mustered up a wink to go with the leer.  "No offense I'm sure."  He resettled the Presidente atop his great squarish head.  Thea just stared, beginning to notice how unreality had <a href="What_If_It_Was_.html">escaped</a> the <a href="Thea_s_War.html">TV box</a>.</p>
