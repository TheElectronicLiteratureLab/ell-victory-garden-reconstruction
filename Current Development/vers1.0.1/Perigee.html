<h1>Perigee</h1>

<p>Madden looked up.  "Asteroids drop in all the time, don't they?  That's where meteor showers come from."</p>

<p>"Hm," said Tate.  "But consider.  The object you're presently viewing, at relatively low magnification I might add, measures more than half a kilometer across.  If it came down, it would not be one of your ordinary meteors."</p>

<p>"Are you saying it's time for some disaster insurance?"</p>

<p>Tate laughed again.  "No, we're quite safe.  Tracking data give a perigee somewhere between 150,000 and 200,000 miles."</p>

<p>Madden tried to remember a few basic astronomical facts, like the distance between the earth and the moon.  Around a quarter-million miles, he thought.  "That's kind of close."</p>
