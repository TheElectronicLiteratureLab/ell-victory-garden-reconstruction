<h1>Up...</h1>

<p>Jude felt along the ornamental panelling, found the concealed pushbutton just where Veronica told her it would be, waited a long ten seconds while nothing happened.  Then the little car arrived and the disguised door pulled back, making a racket that seemed impossible to ignore.</p>

<p>"Fast."</p>

<p>They slipped into the secret elevator and held their breath as the door rolled across.  Jude listened hard for footsteps but heard nothing.  If they were lucky, that meant the guard had been too caught up in the war show to notice the car descending.  On the other hand, maybe he had heard.  Maybe he'd just picked up his radio and called for backup.  Or maybe he wasn't suprised to hear the elevator running because it had been running earlier.  Maybe President Larry was already up there.  Now that could be awkward.  The car rose slowly.  Six, ten, twelve... last stop.  "<a class="textlink"  href="Paranoid.html">P</a>."  For Private.</p>
