<h1>Answer This</h1>

<p>The answer?</p>

<p><em>The answer to these times.  The answer to this frenzy.  The answer to this silent night.  There is an answer to everything and U must find it.  U must find the answer and make it known to all.</p>

</em><p>I can't deal in answers, <a class="textlink"  href="The_White_Suit.html">all I have are questions</a>...</p>

<p><em>Find the answer.</p>

</em><p>What?</p>

<p><em>The answer to everything.</em></p>
