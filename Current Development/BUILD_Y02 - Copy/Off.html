<h1>Off</h1>

<p><em>Is this your answer?</em>  Tate says, modulating on the carrier wave.</p>

<p>And another wave screams off the carrier, forming up on the wingman, maintaining radio silence good to go</p>

<p>Flashing the light in his eyes, on again then off, such a neat little parlor trick really though it does tend to aggravate the arthritis in his thumb...</p>

<p><em>What did you hope to accomplish? </em></p>

<p>An answer, an answer, no answer to the night.</p>
