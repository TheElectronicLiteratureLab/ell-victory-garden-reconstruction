<h1>Silence</h1>

<p>There was a sustained monumental silence in the room, not so much an impressed or startled silence as a kind of sudden rift in the fabric of social reality.</p>

<p>It wasn't just that no one knew what to say or what to think.  It was as if each one had spent the last fifteen minutes being abused in some amazingly degrading manner.</p>

<p>... and had enjoyed every second of it.</p>
