<h1>Absent Brothers</h1>

<p>A few with political attitudes showed up in gas masks or environment suits but most wore plain fatigues painted to look like that "pebbled" camouflage.  </p>

<p>Assuming most of them took tonight's theme at face value, this was a poignant statement indeed.  You had here girlfriends and boyfriends decked out in their lovers' G.I. drag, brothers by blood and bond standing in for absent brothers — all <a class="textlink"  href="Cyborg_Politics.html">fun and games</a> of course (it's the American way) but beneath it just possibly something deeper — could it be solidarity?</p>

<p>Harley was fascinated.  He leaned against the base of the Tower making extensive notes.  "Hey," Veronica objected, "I thought you were on stress leave."  </p>

<p>Which was quite a concept, considering the way he looked.</p>
