<h1>With a Bullet</h1>

<p>"Whose bright idea was this?" Veronica demanded.  Her back was stiff with rage.  "And where does he live?"</p>

<p>"Mark for a soft-nosed bullet," Thea considered.  "You've got an idea there, only I hope you get your bullets by the gross.  This scam is the worst kind of fucking with Mother Nature, but there seems to be a whole lot of <a class="textlink"  href="Rape_in_the_Family.html">motherfuckers</a> in them thar hills."</p>

<p>"Pretty well dug in, too, I'd guess," Miles added.</p>

<p>Veronica sat with fists clenched in her lap.  "Somebody has to do<em>something</em> ."</p>

<p>Harley covered those tight fists with his hand.  "I'll make a trip to the County Building, do a little rototilling of the records, we'll see what <a class="textlink"  href="Unseen.html">connects</a> with what."  Veronica shook her head, still ridden by her fury.</p>
