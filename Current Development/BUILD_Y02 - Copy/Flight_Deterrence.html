<p>Urquhart considered.  "It's at least twenty hours point-to-point."</p>

<p>Macarthur went on tapping away, peering up for a second as Walter <a class="textlink"  href="Cronkite.html">Cronkite</a> came on one of the screens.  "True," he allowed finally, "but you're not at the mercy of the planes."</p>
