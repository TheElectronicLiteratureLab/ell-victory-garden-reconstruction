<h1>What If It Was?</h1>

<p>"Suppose it was," Veronica allowed.  "What's it to you?"</p>

<p>Billy Van scratched a floppy earlobe, pondering the implications.  "Wahl y'know, Runnin' Bird, Ah al'ays did regard you as havin' more cojones than half the so-called bad hombres in this town."</p>

<p>"I'm touched," Veronica said.  "But the SWAT team's overdue.  Get to the point."</p>

<p>The cowboy-agitator pulled himself up and straightened his Lone Star belt buckle.  "Perfessor Agnew," he told Thea, "me'n the boys here don' exactly approve of yore tryin' t' stomp on Western Civilization an' our Amurkin way've lahf.  And Ah do confess  we come up here tonight t'make a purty emphatic show of our displeasure.  But owin' to the respect Ah have fer our young friend there, Ah'm gonna advise mah associates t' leave peaceably." </p>
