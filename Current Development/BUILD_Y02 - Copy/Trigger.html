<h1>Trigger</h1>

<p>"Business?" Urquhart asked, crossing over to a battered old wardrobe, reaching in for something.</p>

<p>Madden wasn't much pleased with this.  "Say Boris," he called over, leaving the edge on his voice.  "It's sort of dark in here, and I've got these dangerous reflexes.  Call me an old paranoid, but humor me and come out with whatever that is real slow, okay?"</p>

<p>Urquhart froze for a second, then backed away from the wardrobe very slowly.  He was holding up a set of khaki fatigues, neatly hung and pressed.  He peeled back the zipper and patted down the pockets the better to set Madden's mind at rest.</p>

<p>"Sure am sorry about that," Madden told him.  "It's just I hate accidents, you know?"</p>

<p>Urquhart eased off his leather jacket, keeping his hands visible.  "Everyone's on a hair trigger these days."</p>
