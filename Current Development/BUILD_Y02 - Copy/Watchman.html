<p>"Eighteen thousand years I been up here," the watchman begins.  "Since <a class="textlink"  href="Conquering_Hero.html">the second Eisenhower administration</a>.  I was put here to watch.  What am I supposed to watch for? I thought to ask.  That's your lookout, they said, <a class="textlink"  href="O_O.html">just you watch</a>.  So I sat up here and I watched.  And I watched.  And I watched some more."</p>

<p>"Then you saw it," you suggest.</p>

<p>"No actually I saw it the first five minutes I was up here.  But after all I was told to watch, right? so after I saw it I went on watching."</p>

<p>"Well obviously."</p>

<p>"But guess what I saw."</p>
