<h1>Violent Mistake</h1>

<p>"Like most violent acts," Thea explained, "there was no justification.  I was standing on a streetcorner reading some kind of poster.  I think it was for a women's rights rally.  Doctor Nagel came by and I thought he said to me, 'Don't believe everything you read, girlie.'  So I turned around and let him have it."</p>

<p>"Pow, right in the kisser."</p>

<p>"I'm<em>not</em>   proud of this, Roy."</p>

<p>"Yeah, okay, maybe you overreacted.  But the man was being a sexist asshole, right?"</p>

<p>"Wrong.  Nagel wasn't talking to me, he was talking to the man standing next to him, a guy called Charles Earlie.  And they were talking about somebody's polymer research, not about the rally."</p>

<p>"Whoops."</p>
