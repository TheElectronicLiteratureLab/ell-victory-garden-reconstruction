<p>"Post-history," Heidel recited with evident disgust.  "Postindustrialism.  Postmodernism.  <a class="textlink"  href="Mr_Postman_Look_See.html">Post-<em>humanism</em>.</a>  If there weren't so many of them who take it seriously, I'd find it all laughable.  It's gotten to the point where I'm ashamed to talk about what I do."</p>

<p>"Well," Madden allowed,  "I certainly know that feeling."</p>

<p>"They're all so eager to leave things behind â€” to leave<em>us</em>  behind," Heidel pointed out.  "They want to pretend they're in another country, a country without any connection to our heritage of laws and beliefs, our common adherence to <a class="textlink"  href="Not_Right.html">reason</a> and the rule of law."</p>

<p>Madden uncrossed his legs and got slowly to his feet.  "Sounds serious, Professor.  But I'm afraid you're in a better position to deal with it than I am."</p>
