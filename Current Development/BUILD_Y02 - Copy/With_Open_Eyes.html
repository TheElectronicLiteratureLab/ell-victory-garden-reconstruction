<h1>With Open Eyes</h1>

<p>"Whatever that means.  But wait, this is the really scary part.  At the end of the dream my eyes actually came open and they stared right at me.  Only, the eyes in that body weren't my eyes.  They were these bright baby-blues."</p>

<p>"Yeah, well, okay, weird.  I admit that might put me off my medication for a while."</p>

<p>"But that isn't the scary part."</p>

<p>Urquhart nodded.  "Somehow I didn't think so."</p>

<p>"The scary part is that when I woke up, my eyes — this pair here — really <em>were</em>  open."</p>

<p>Urquhart tossed half the melon over the terrace rail and the grackle took off after it.  "Gee, and they're such a lovely shade of blue, too."</p>

<p>"Not funny."</p>
