<h1>l'État de Tate</h1>
<em>




<p>I have some understanding of labyrinths: not for nothing am I the great grandson of that Ts'ui Pên who was governor of Yunnan and who renounced worldly power in order to write a novel that might be even more populous than the  </em>Hung Lu Meng<em> and to construct a labyrinth in which all men would become lost.</p>

                                                                      </em><p>— Overheard in a Chinese Garden</p>
