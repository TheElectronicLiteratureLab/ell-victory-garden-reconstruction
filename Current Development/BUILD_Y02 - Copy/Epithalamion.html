<h1>Epithalamion</h1>

<p><em>Writing what?</em>  I wondered.  When I'd known Harley Morgan he'd been strictly a creature of the airwaves, helpless without his camera crew.</p>

<p><em>Writing I don't really know what,</em>  Harley told me.  <em>Whatever comes into my head when I sit down at the Mac.  Stories, essays, letters to Bernie Shaw.</p>

<p>He wrote a Wedding Ode for Ted and Jane,</em>  Veronica boasted.  <em>Boy did that suck.</p>

<p>Did not.</p>

<p>Did too, I'm sure,  </em>Thea tossed in.</p>
