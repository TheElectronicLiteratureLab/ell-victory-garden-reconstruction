<h1>Query</h1>

<p>"First question," Madden said, taking out a steno pad.  "How long has it been since you last logged onto your SIMUNET account?"</p>

<p>Urquhart stepped into the legs of the coveralls, trying to remember.  SIMUNET provided time-sharing access to military supercomputers.  It had been set up some months ago for a series of system simulations.  Security was heavy, partly because the subject of the models was an orbital defense system â€” but mainly because the models always failed in the most embarrassing ways.</p>

<p>"I've done my best to forget that particular project," Urquhart said.  "As far as I can recall, I haven't been on SIMUNET since about the middle of last April."  </p>

<p>Madden listened carefully, using his best detective's ear.  Though as he knew, his own impression hardly mattered.  Sooner or later they'd have to wire Urquhart up and see what came out on the graphs.</p>
