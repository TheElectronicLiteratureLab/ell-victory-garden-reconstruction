<h1>Speaking of Which...</h1>

<p>"Jude Busch.  I took your Artificial Paranoia course in '87, sat through half of your Postmodern Delusions in '89, switched my major from philosophy and got an A from you in Interactive Aesthetics last fall.  You gave special permission to let me into 8088 this term."</p>

<p>"I did?"</p>

<p>"Sort of.  You really did want to sign that letter, believe me."</p>

<p>"Ah."</p>

<p>"Speaking of which, we've been missing you in seminar."</p>
