<h1>On Schedule</h1>

<p>Leroy scratched his ringlets for a while.  "I don't know," he said, it's a strange place <a class="textlink"  href="On_the_Road.html">out there in America</a>."</p>

<p>"It's always been that, love."</p>

<p>"And now they're talking about another war.  Y'know, Mom, most of the people I talked to seem to think it's on some kind of goddam<em>schedule </em> â€” like it was a TV special."</p>

<p>"Pretty scary, isn't it?"  She sat up and crossed her legs.  "But what do you do with that fear, Roy?  Do you just walk on down the street figuring '<a class="textlink"  href="I_m_OK.html">I'm OK</a>' and hope it doesn't get too bad?  Or do you try to change the way things are?  Do you think that change is possible?"</p>

<p>He thought it over.  "Maybe.  I just don't see <a class="textlink"  href="What_Should_I_Do_.html">how to make it happen</a>."</p>
