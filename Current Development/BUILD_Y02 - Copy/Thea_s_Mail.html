<h1>Thea's Mail</h1>

<p>"What are you doing here anyway?" Thea wanted to know.  "The Committee isn't on till eleven."</p>

<p>"I brought your <a class="textlink"  href="From_a_Hot_Place.html">mail</a>," Urquhart explained.  He held up a thick stack of paper goods: envelopes postal and interoffice, newspaper cuttings, a paperclipped copy of <em>Newsweek</em>.</p>

<p>"I want to cry," Thea said.  "No.  I want to kill."</p>

<p>"We've got editorials in both local papers again, a news item in the Atlanta <em>Constitution,</em>  and George Will.  There's also the transcript from <a class="textlink"  href="Transcript.html">Heidel</a> on Larry King."</p>

<p>"<a class="textlink"  href="Bad.html">Delightful</a>."</p>

<p>He picked out a thick <a class="textlink"  href="Emily_to_Thea.html">airmail</a> envelope.  "This one is from <a class="textlink"  href="Poor_Correspondent.html">Emily</a>."</p>
