Dear Victor,
</p><p>
Thanks for your letters.  I'm holding up.  I'm managing.  This is a strange place and a strange time but we're all going to make it thru somehow.  I hope things back in Tara aren't really as bad as you derscribe.  Try not to be so angry.
</p><p>
I wish you could accept the way things are.  I don't want to pretend nothing happened between us but I meant it when I said there couldn't be anything more.  I'm with 
<a class="textlink"  href="No_Genius.html">Boris</a> 
for good or bad and that's the right thing for me.  If that's cruel, I'm sorry.  Its honest.
</p><p>
Give it some time.  Balme it all on me if it helps, but get your head together please.  I don't like all this pain.
</p><p>
Your friend,
</p></tt>
