<h1>Where Troubles Melt</h1>

<p>The Sigma Omega boys hadn't had this much fun since their last Mexican holiday.  Though most of them were pretty blasé about smashing cars (<em>again? </em>), the act took on new meaning for them when it became part of a violent political statement.  It was a whole new ballgame.  Why, this demonstration stuff was just a <em>pisser</em> .</p>

<p>Overcome by the joy of demolition, Vance climbed up on the roof of the sacrificial bus, which was — look out — about to lose its windshield.  He always was something of a showman, that Vance.  Finding a somewhat precarious balance, he sang out in a surprisingly fine baritone:</p>

<p>"<a class="textlink"  href="Because_Because_Because.html">Some-WHERE</a> oh-ver the <a class="textlink"  href="Rainbow.html">rain-BOW</a>!"</p>

<p>But presently the wrecking crew set the old hulk to rocking so hard that Vance was thrown into the hedge.</p>
