<h1>Same Old Emily?</h1>
<tt>
<p>You know what really scares me, Emily, it's the <a class="textlink"  href="Failure.html">changes</a>.  What scares me most is the thought of <u>you</u> changing.</p>

<p>What will you be like when I see you again?  I try to picture your face coming down the airplane steps, sunburnt and thinner.  Tougher, maybe.  Same old Emily?  I don't know.</p>

<p>Will you really be able to go back to the way you were, hanging out and not-writing your thesis, watching Boris through his ups and downs, or who knows, maybe taking up with this other fellow you</p>

<p>Will you be happy back here under the big old trees, sitting in seminar or back in the Just Say No</p>

<p>Or &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;?</p>
