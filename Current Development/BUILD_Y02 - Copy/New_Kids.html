<h1>New Kids</h1>

<p>It isn't really my own ass I worry about â€” though ask the Marines or Airborne about that sometime.  It's pretty easy to be cocky when you're just G.I. Jane, Combat Postal Clerk.  No, I worry more about what happens after this show.  What are things going to be like down the line?  I worry about the changes.  </p>

<p>You were the bad boys and girls, the hippies and yippies and dopers and freaks, exactly the sort of lowlife scum that y'all don't want <a class="textlink"  href="Hustler.html">your children</a> to know now they're old enough for social diseases.</p>

<p>But check out the new kids on the block, why look Martha they've got <u>haircuts</u>.  They're decent, cleanshaven examples of <a class="textlink"  href="Suit_Time.html">military discipline</a> like Bush Nixon & <a class="textlink"  href="Watch_My_Back.html">Elvis</a>.    </p>

<p>I'm not sure I like being part of this Good to Go generation, just another one of them happy warriors who went and did the job.  </p>

<p>That's the thing about being Reliable.  Who can say what they'll want from us the next time?</p>
