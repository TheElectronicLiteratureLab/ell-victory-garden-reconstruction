<h1>Noon</h1>

<p>Midday and I need focusing.  My mind won't stay on the subject.  I have a head full of budget cuts and the job market.  So I go out to walk in the redwoods and next thing I know I'm turning up her path, I'm picking up her mail, I'm at her door.</p>

<p>I find her in the swimming pool.  "It's the middle of the day.  You're going native," I tell her.</p>

<p>She puts her head out and does a slow breast stroke.  "I'm beginning to feel like I've always belonged in this place."</p>

<p>"But don't you miss <a class="textlink"  href="Whitman_s_Creek.html">Tara</a>?"</p>

<p>She goes back under, her head turned.  I don't know whether she didn't hear me or chose not to hear.  I watch her swim an underwater lap, strong and smooth.</p>
