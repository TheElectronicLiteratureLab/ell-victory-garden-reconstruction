<p>Tate shrugged and pushed himself off the railing.  "Well as long as you've dropped by, I've got something here I'd like to show you.  Something you might find interesting."</p>

<p>Tate turned to an old metal cabinet and reached to a high shelf, taking down an old leather portfolio, stitched up with thick black ribbon and stuffed untidily with papers, yellowed and creased with age.  "This came into my hands years ago," Tate explained, "but I've only just realized its importance."</p>

<p>He cleared a space on the workbench and set the portfolio in front of them.  "I've been studying Japanese over the last few years, and I've finally become good enough with the script to decipher this."  He opened the leather folio carefully, revealing a large page of rice paper written over in graceful, trailing brush strokes.</p>
