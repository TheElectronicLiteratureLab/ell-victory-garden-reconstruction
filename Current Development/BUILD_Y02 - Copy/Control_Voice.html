<h1>Control Voice</h1>

<p>They <a class="textlink"  href="Need_to_Know.html">all lived</a>, she thought, in the Mondo Video — her own generation as much as Leroy's generation and Veronica's.  Who could deny it?  What would it mean to resist?  </p>

<p>For some reason Thea felt an old recollection bubbling up from deep memory.  It was a sci-fi series she used to watch in her school days, the one that started each week with a test pattern, an oscilloscope trace, a picture of the moon.  And yes oh yes The Control Voice. <em>There is nothing wrong with your television set.  Do not attempt to adjust the picture.  </em> </p>

<p>Thea knew even then that it was pure camp — Ernie Kovacs meets the monster movies.  <em>We can make the image a shapeless blur... or give it crystal clarity.</em>   But that little voiceover came back to her tonight with a different spin.  She could see now that it was the the truest thing ever said on the air. </p>

<p><em>We control <a class="textlink"  href="Talkin_bout_the_Horror.html">the horror</a>.  We control the <a class="textlink"  href="Images.html">video</a>.</em></p>
