<p>The land beneath your hurtling body is undeniably Nebraska.  Look over there, see, it say "LINCOLN" in big block letters.  So over here, yeah, this thing looks like a bullseye you're dropping toward, why that must be the "O" in O-O —</p>

<p>Flash of matte black skin cleaves the cloudy firmament, now you see it now you don't, now you do: here she is, bird, Beast, great wings spread V-for-Veritas, turbine scream clearly audible as you fall closer closer clearly on track to intercept...
