<h1>Streets</h1>

<p>Thea felt her head begin to reel.  Leroy, her son.  Not yet sixteen and the kid was somewhere out beyond the orbit of Neal Casady, headed either for Lenny Bruce or Jesse James â€” or maybe some destination still undisclosed.  Where would eighteen find him, or twenty-four, or thirty-three?  Did she really want to know?</p>

<p>Leroy was leaning against the sliding doors staring out into the quiet night.  "I think I know the way you and Dad felt," he was saying.  "I think I know why you wanted to get out in the streets, war or no war."  He pushed his hair back absently and Thea started, seeing his father so clearly in that move.  "There's something about the streets," he said.</p>

<p>"Try to think it through," she said as gently as she could manage.  "Try to find a reason."</p>

<p>He looked back at her quizzically.</p>
