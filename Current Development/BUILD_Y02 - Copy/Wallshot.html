<p>So you look to your left and across the entire north face of the cliff here's this enormous East-bloc-dictator-size glossy depicting the 38th Vice President of the United States, Spiro T. "My Kind of Guy" Agnew big schnozz beady eyes and all, and strung along beneath it there's this banner festooned with purple and pink bunting and it say:</p>

                <p><strong>WELCOME DELEGATES TO FIRST INTERNATIONAL spiroCON</strong></p>

<p>You're trying to slot this into your gestalt when some very small person with prominent incisors wearing a black plastic mac tugs you by the sleeve and when you finish brushing him off and look back, watchaknow... that sign... it's just... GONE!</p>

<p>You didn't see that, the munchkin says.  You look down and notice he's wearing an elaborate rosette name tag.  <em>HI THERE!  Just call me</em>   <u>Leonard G. Agnew</u> !  You look at your own lapel where there's a similar device blossoming and it say <em>AND I'M   </em><u>Miles Q. Agnew</u>, <em>PLEASETAMEETCHA!</em></p>
