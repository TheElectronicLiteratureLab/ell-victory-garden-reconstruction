<h1>Dexter's Story</h1>

<p>"When I was back in Jersey I was hung up on this girl named Sasha Meninger," Dexter recounted.  "She was a real classy number, kind of like the Runbird only spacier."</p>

<p>"Jeez Dex, I hope this is not gonna be one of your I-caught-her-in-bed-with-another-</p>
<p>guy stories."</p>

<p>"Actually it was another girl, but that ain't the point."  Dexter fished out a water bottle and took a long swig for irrigation.  "I was trying like hell to impress her.  She hung with this bunch of art students from Pace, most of them were in a band called Machine Vomit."</p>

<p>"Oh yeah.  They covered 'Born to Run' with a trombone and accordion arrangement.  I heard it at a party once and it actually made me puke."</p>

<p>"Yeah, right, anyway."</p>
