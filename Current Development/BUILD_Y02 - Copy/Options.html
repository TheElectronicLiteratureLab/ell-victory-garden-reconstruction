<p>"Tell us about it, Dexter."</p>

<p>"Well okay, so maybe it's not D-Day, maybe it's not the jungle â€” but still, it ain't like you can relax, either.  The Iraqis got a couple thousand MiGs, they got long-range rockets, they got gas, they got anthrax.  Who knows, maybe they even got the Bomb."</p>

<p>"Medium-range," Emily corrected.  "<a class="textlink"  href="Worry_.html">Scuds</a> only go a couple hundred miles.  Those Frogs don't reach even that far.  So don't worry, they can't drop anything nasty on us <a class="textlink"  href="Mail.html">Combat Mailmen</a>."</p>
