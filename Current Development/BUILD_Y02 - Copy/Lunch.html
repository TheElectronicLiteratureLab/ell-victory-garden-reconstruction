<h1>Lunch</h1>

<p>"I always thought sushi was, like, raw fish," Leroy observes between mouthfuls.</p>

<p>"That's sashimi," I explain.  "Though you'll find the odd bit of tuna in there if you look."  At the rate he's going there isn't time to look, which is a shame really.  This is art food, not your usual processed <a class="textlink"  href="13-F.html">eatstuff</a>.</p>

<p>"Roy's been culturally deprived," Thea apologizes.</p>

<p>Ever attentive, Leroy sees an opening.  "Say, Mom, could I spend next summer in <a class="textlink"  href="Complicated.html">Tokyo</a>?"</p>

<p>"No.  Why?"</p>

<p>He gives her the standard <em>you don't get it, do you</em>  look.  "<a class="textlink"  href="Heirloom.html">VR</a>, of course."</p>
