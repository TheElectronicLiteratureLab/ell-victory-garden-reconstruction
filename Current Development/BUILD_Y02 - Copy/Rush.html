<h1>Rush</h1>

<p>Snyder thought about it.  "You can't go back," he allowed.  "Like most everything I can name, with one or two exceptions, it's a young man's game.  Aviation in particular.  I flew choppers, Hueys, recon and air rescue.  It was a definite rush, that I will not deny.  I got it so bad that I joined up with the Border Patrol in '77 because I thought they'd let me stay in the air."</p>

<p>Madden nodded and ordered another round.  You heard your share of war stories in this line of work.</p>

<p>"Once or twice a month Divisional Intelligence would get some kind of Resistance Assessment hardon and all the single guys would get out the deck and draw.  Low card got to take the newest bird on the lot for a twenty minute tour up B-B Alley.  What we'd do when he got back, if he managed it, was we'd walk around his ship and tote up the holes.  The ones in your own ass didn't count."</p>
