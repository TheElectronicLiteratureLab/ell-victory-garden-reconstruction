<h1>Just do it</h1>

<p>"MAD-den, MAD-den."</p>
<p>"Come on, Gerry, show us what you do when you execute a collar."</p>

<p>"Aw cripes."  After nearly ten years <a class="textlink"  href="John_Law.html">Madden</a> was well and truly tired of this game, but here was Nicky Cott from DEA with Madden's favorite single malt, and well, you know these guys.</p>

<p>Madden got down from his stool, came up behind Snyder, planted his hammy hooks either side of the suspect's tanned neck.  The bar fell silent, expectant.</p>

<p>Madden pursed his lips.  "DOINK!"</p>
