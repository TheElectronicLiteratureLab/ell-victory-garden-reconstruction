<p>The momentum carried her off her feet and back against the etched mirror behind the bar.  The glass cracked and buckled and she caromed off, taking a dozen liquor bottles with her to the floor.  The crash of it all must have been enormous but she was not aware of hearing it. </p>

<p>When she hit the linoleum she lost her wind and lay there trying to gasp, thinking about screaming, charged with adrenaline but frozen to the floor.  She wondered if she was bleeding.  </p>

<p>Men were moving toward her, a couple of med students and an off-duty cop.
