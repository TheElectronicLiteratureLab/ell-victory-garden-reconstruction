<p>Every time I hear this story, the Kiosk says, whether it's told by a rabbi, a priest, a minister, or a doctor of philosophy, it comes out with the same happy ending.  The spirit returns, the monks are saved.  How inspiring, how full of hope.</p>

<p>How sad and unreal.  </p>

<p>Because I know what I'm talking about — I've been to those deep woods, I've seen the weathered scraps of the rabbi's hut and the broken walls of the old monastery.  And that's not all I've seen.</p>

<p>Buried in the old kitchen midden I found the skeletons of three old men, each showing the same distinctive marks.  The ribcages had been pierced, the wrists and ankles shattered.</p>

<p>What can this mean?</p>
