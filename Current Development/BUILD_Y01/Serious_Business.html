<p>"Oh I'm sure it is," Tate replied.  "The war, the big story."  He paused to key in an adjustment.  A second, smaller motor flicked on for a few seconds and a hydraulic line hissed.  "How close we can come to the truth and yet still be utterly ignorant."</p>

<p>"What are you talking about?" Heidel demanded.</p>

<p>Tate made him wait another moment or two before he answered.  "The real story's in the sky, all right, but it isn't necessarily the sky over Baghdad.  There's a good deal more going on tonight than most people suspect."</p>
