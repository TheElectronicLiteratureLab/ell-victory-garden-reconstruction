<h1>Noted in Passing</h1>

<p>Madden made the most of available light: he always saw what he could see.  It was a professional reflex, a skill of his trade.  When someone turned on a table lamp in a distant window or, as in this case, drove by with his map light on, Madden noticed.  Which was how Madden came to spot Erich K. Heidel driving in some haste out of the observatory parking lot just as he pulled his own car into the drive, right on time for his 8:00 meet with Tate.</p>

<p>It was also part of the reflex to be curious about what the light revealed to you, especially when that revelation pointed toward some coincidence or pattern.  Madden had no idea what Heidel would want with Tate.  Were there more moves afoot to crush the Politically Correct?  Or was it correctness that Heidel wanted â€” Madden could never keep it straight.  He did however recognize the basic significance of the event: Heidel's being here at this of all moments meant that he was a player, a man with access to power.  What game Heidel was playing Madden could only guess.  His business tonight was with Tate.</p>
