<h1>Mourning</h1>

<p>Thea comes to me today full of plans and demands, all that gloom and depression behind her at last.  We need to rewrite the chapter on orgasmic narrative.  Have I reread Haraway on situated knowledge yet?  Why won't her Macintosh boot from the external hard drive?  Do I still have that Sandra Bernhard video?</p>

<p>I think it means something, this sudden resurgence of energy.  I think it means she's beginning to be at home here, to accept her place in the sun.  <a class="textlink"  href="Miles.html">Waking up in California</a> â€” sooner or later we all do.</p>

<p>She sits on my deck wearing one of my old floppy hats, reading last week's<em>Chronicle</em>  and doing a sort of blow-by-blow description.  I've never met anyone for whom academic culture seemed so much like a blood sport.</p>

<p>My mornings aren't the same without her.</p>
