<h1>Surprise Call</h1>

<p>Sometimes lately we forget whose house we're in.  Thea will pick up the phone at my place and seems surprised when the call's for me.  I do it too.  A few weeks ago the phone rang at one in the morning, a little after we'd both drifted off.  Thea was slower to wake up, so I answered.</p>

<p><em>Hello.</p>
<p>Thea?</p>

</em><p>I was still a bit fuzzy.  <em>No it isn't, who's —</p>
<p>Waitaminute — I know who  </em>that<em> is!  Bet you don't know who this is, though...</p>

</em><p>But I did know.  <a class="textlink"  href="Long_Distance.html"><em>Harley</a>! </p>
<p>None other.</em></p>
