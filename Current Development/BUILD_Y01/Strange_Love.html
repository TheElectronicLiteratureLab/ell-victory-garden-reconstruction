<h1>Strange Love</h1>

<p>Yes folks, love <em>is</em>  strange.</p>

<p>They lay there, Jude and Victor, thigh by thigh, head-to-foot and foot-to-head, joined by the interlaced fingers of their right hands.  Their pulses were racing and their breath came heavily, beads of sweat lay on their brows, especially Jude's under that wig.  They were momentarily speechless.</p>

<p>But don't jump to conclusions.  Neither one had officially come, though they'd both been amazingly close, a mere synapse-breadth away.  Granted, there had been a climax of sorts for both of them.  There had even been an ejaculation.</p>

<p>But not the usual kind.</p>
