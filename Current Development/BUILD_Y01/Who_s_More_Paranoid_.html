<p>"And you haven't divulged your SIMUNET password to any friends or acquaintances?"</p>

<p>Urquhart zipped up his fatigues and stared at him flatly.  "Oh of course.  Every time I shit in a public john, I write each and every password for all my computer accounts in large block letters on the stall door.  Right under my unlisted phone number, the access code for my automatic teller card, and the amazing length of my willy."</p>

<p>"Yeah, well.  I had to ask."</p>

<p>"I'm a computer scientist, Agent Madden.  That means there are some things I'm even more paranoid about than you."</p>
