<p>"You managed.  Would you care to elaborate on that?"</p>

<p>"I got married," Heidel related.  "My wife's family is very prominent in this state.  They helped me get my life back in order, in many more ways than one."</p>

<p>Madden added a page or three to the mental file.  "Just out of curiosity, what was your wife's maiden name?"</p>

<p>"Baumann."</p>

<p>"As in Larry S. Baumann?"  As in oil, newspapers, politics, and a couple of interesting S&L's.</p>
