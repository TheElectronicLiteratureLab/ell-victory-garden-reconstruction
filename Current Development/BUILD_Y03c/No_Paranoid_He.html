<h1>No Paranoid He</h1>

<p>"I don't consider myself a <a class="textlink"  href="Freak_Whence_He.html">paranoid</a>, Agent Madden."</p>

<p>No reason to doubt that.  You didn't need Madden's professional expertise to read the sense of injured conviction and probity in that round-eyed stare.  "I'm not talking about <a class="textlink"  href="Facemask.html">plots and conspiracies</a>.  It's all in the open, anybody can see what's going on.  Our educational system is completely out of step with the rest of the country, and it's the fault of this radical clique who pull all the strings."</p>

<p>Madden dutifully wrote something.</p>

<p>"In the seventies, when the rest of the country woke up and faced facts, these people just went deeper into their own radicalism, further away from reality.  You remember how that was."</p>

<p>There was an edge to this remark that Madden couldn't ignore.  "I suppose so."</p>
