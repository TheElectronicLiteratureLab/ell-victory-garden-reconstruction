<h1>Among Friends</h1>

<p>"Boris you twisted fuck.  Anything happens to this car, I'll pull your balls off and hang them up like fuzzy dice."</p>

<p>Urquhart made a screaming full-gee turn onto 15th, straying into the oncoming lane and narrowly missing another car.</p>

<p>"Aiyee."  Harley began to feel sick.</p>

<p>Urquhart peered into his side mirror.  "Straighten up, Harley.  I need your help."</p>

<p>Harley was rooting around the footwell looking for something persuasive, beer bottle, tire iron, brick, something like that.</p>

<p>"That car we just passed, was it a big dark blue sedan?  Like something out of <em>Hawaii Five-O</em>  ?"</p>
