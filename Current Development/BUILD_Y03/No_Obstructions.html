<h1>No Obstructions</h1>

<p>26ˆth Street.  This was where East Main became West Main, proceeding for six or seven blocks without interruptions.  The speedometer said 75 and Urquhart figured that was fast enough.  Madden was still tailing him, but without siren or flashers yet, and he seemed to be falling behind.  The lights on 26ˆth were yellow.  Urquhart put on a bit more speed.</p>

<p>West Hills Linen Service's truck 17 was almost a half hour late on its rounds.  The driver, Jaime Colón of 1928 Laredo Drive, East Tara, had spent 40 minutes earlier that evening in the lounge of the Plaza Del Rio restaurant, watching the Desert Storm news on TV.  Mr. Colón had two brothers and a sister in the Gulf.  He was anxious about them.  Now he was anxious about his job, too.  Mr. Colón had been warned twice about lateness.  When he saw the yellow light at 26ˆth, he also put on a little more speed.  He had just turned onto 26ˆth from Bustamante and was approaching from the south at about 35 miles per hour.</p>
