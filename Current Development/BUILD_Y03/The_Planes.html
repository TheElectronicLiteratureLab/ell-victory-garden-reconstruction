<h1>The Planes</h1>

<p>Macarthur always referred to any aspect of air travel as <em>The Planes</em>.  Many people found this odd, though Urquhart wasn't one of them.  He'd spent his boyhood living under the glide path of an airport that once had the resonant name of Friendship.  Folks in his neighborhood said <em>The Planes</em>  all the time, meaning those great noisy presences always overhead.  Since many of the local jobs were in radar and avionics, they were referred to with affection and even reverence.  They were flying temples of the god Technology, moving symbols of the national will, reminders of our passage.  </p>

<p>But when Macarthur said<em>The Planes</em>, you were meant to recognize it as the title of a film, to wit the world's longest-running horror movie.  Get him started on the subject and he'd sooner or later deliver his Hannah Arendt shtick: "Banality of evil?  Just check out a <em>crash scene</em>  sometime..."</p>

<p>Urquhart actually like flying.  To him The Planes were fascinating, beautiful.  But then he'd never seen one in pieces.</p>
