<h1>Outnumbered</h1>

<p><a class="textlink"  href="Now_Here_This.html">Now hear this</a>.  The voice of Old Man Reason.  <em>The girl is crazy; what she says can have no value.</em></p>

<p>No she's not.  Yes it can.</p>

<p>Some months ago, for no reason he could recall, Urquhart had cut out of a French magazine this great scowling icon of the late Ayatollah.  He'd pinned it to his office door for a week or so, then moved it inside and taped it over his desk.  Finally he ran it through the scanner and processed it into a digital background for his virtual desktop.  Lately when the Old Man's voice rumbled up he could almost see the bushy eyebrows twitch, those taut lips begin to stir.  Bloodthirsty and intolerant, fitting image for the Voice of Reason.</p>

<p>Just who was the madman around here, he began to wonder.  But anyway, he thought, now U has the old fucker outnumbered.</p>
