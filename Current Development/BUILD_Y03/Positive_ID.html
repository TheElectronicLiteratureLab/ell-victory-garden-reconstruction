<h1>Positive ID</h1>

<p>Two sweaty men in helmets and leather jackets grabbed Urquhart and threw him against the side of the Porsche.  He dropped down on his ass.</p>

<p>"Lookit this," one of them said, "it's Sodomy Shame himself."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it.  Forget the cuffs, Charley, go get some o' that yellow ribbon."  Urquhart tried to get his feet under him but the first cop hooked his stick behind his heels, knocking him down again.</p>

<p>"Sarge, look.  This guy's dressed up for Hallowe'en.  Maybe he was on his way to a protest march or something."</p>

<p>"What've we got in the car?"</p>

<p>"Keep your shirt on, I'm looking.  Oh hey.  Bingo."  Automatic pistol, 9 mm.</p>
