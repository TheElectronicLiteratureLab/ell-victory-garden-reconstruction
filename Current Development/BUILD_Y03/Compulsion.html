<h1>Compulsion</h1>

<p>This time the feeling of unreality took root and grew and Veronica felt herself break into a cold sweat.</p>

<p>For no reason she could think of she kept moving through the crowd, which had come close to some kind of equilibrium.  It was a strange inspiration, a kind of compulsion to remain in motion while everyone else seemed fixed in place.  She started to perceive what she was doing as a thing with its own end, like ritual movement or dance.  </p>

<p>She began to look at their faces as she passed them, each one very much the same â€” slackjawed and turned up to receive the news.  They moved out of her way inattentively, preserving their lines of sight.  She began to stare right into their faces.  Only a few returned her gaze.</p>
