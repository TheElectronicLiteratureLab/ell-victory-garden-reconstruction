<em>Victory Garden</em> is a hypertext fiction: a story with multiple paths and possibilities.  As a work of <em>new media</em> (whatever that was), it also consists, as Lev Manovich always says, of "one or more interfaces to a database."  The database in this case is a set of about 1300 files comprising webpages, graphics, and a few other things.  Your primary interface is your browser application, through which you'll have access to those pages, many including the diagram you see on the left.  This is the <em>reader interface</em>.
</p><p>
The reader interface has nine parts, labeled here in red.  Here's a quick rundown, followed by some context.  At the top (A) is a link to a schematic map, a graphical table of contents.  You can use it to find entry points into the fiction.  The next element (B) will take you to a list of <strong>Streams</strong> (more about these shortly), many of which are included in the map, along with a whole lot that aren't.  Below these elements is a doubly bifurcated figure with five clickable points.  Its upper arms hold two links, left and right. The lefthand point (C) moves you backward in whatever Stream you are currently reading.  The righthand point (D) moves you forward.  You can also use the LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys on your keyboard, if the device you are using has these.  The square in the middle of the curved figure (E) will bring you to the page you are currently reading ("Read Me") -- so you can always find your way back here if you need a refresher.
</p><p>
In the lower half of the interface is another pair of limbs, holding click points for <strong>Paths</strong> (we're getting to those).  As with the Stream controls above, the one on the left (F) takes you backward along whatever Path you're currently assigned, while the righthand option (G) advances through the sequence.  Arrow keys can also come into play here: UP for forward on a Path, DOWN for reverse.  The square below the lower limbs (H) links to a list of all the possible Paths, should you be curious about them.  the final element (I) links back to the arrival page on which you started.  It's basically a RESTART button.
</p><p>
Now, what exactly are these <strong>Paths</strong> and <strong>Streams</strong>?  In a hypertext fiction there's no singular storyline.  Instead there are vignettes, episodes, and fragments of text that can be put together in a variety of ways.  In the original version of <em>Victory Garden</em> there were only Paths (and textlinks of course; we're coming to those).  You were intended to find your way to a Path by traversing the <strong>Labyrinth</strong>, a section of the text in which you find your way to a completed sentence by choosing one of a pair of words.  That structure remains in this version.  Starting from the <a href='titlePage.html'>title page</a>, you can enter the Labyrinth by clicking on either of the "forward buttons" (D or G in the diagram), or pressing a corresponding arrow key.  Navigate the labyrinth however you like -- and by the way, taking the "forward" option without clicking on a word allows the system to choose for you -- and you will arrive at the start of a Path.  The name of the Path will be indicated at the top of whatever page you come to (it's the word or phrase to the left of the dot; the indication to the right of the dot is your Stream).
</p><p>
There are 52 predefined paths.  Generally speaking they are not linear or coherent readings.  They skip around in strange and devious ways.  They're a bit like opening a book at random -- or in one interesting case, like turning the pages backward.  If you're looking for something approximating conventional fiction, don't bother with Paths.  If exploration is your thing, try them out.
</p><p>
<strong>Streams</strong>, introduced in <em>Victory Garden 2022</em>, deliver something more coherent.  With some exceptions, Streams follow characters through discrete times and situations.  There are 42 Streams, listed on the <a href='Streamlines.html'>Streamlines</a> page.  As noted, there is no single, definitive through-line for the work as a whole, so you can read the Streams in any order.  The sequence in which they are listed on the Streamlines page is not entirely arbitrary, but it's also not definitive.
</p><p>
Can you see every page in <em>Victory Garden</em> by following the Streams and/or Paths?  No.  Some readable pages are not included in either structure.  All those pages are reachable via <strong>textlinks</strong> -- except for one.  (That unreachable page is... let's just say legendary.)  Textlinks, of course, are the usual stuff of the World Wide Web.  In ancient days before the Web, when <em>Victory Garden</em> was first written, Michael Joyce and Jay Bolter spoke of "words that yield," meaning they offer a transition from one page to another.  Most pages in the work have textlinks, though some do not -- follow Path or Stream in those cases.  Textlinks are generally not like those in choice-based adventure games. Mainly they do not function in a plot-driven way (unless they do), but instead express resonances or incidental associations.
</p><p>
If you are reading <em>Victory Garden</em> on a device with a touch interface, swiping at either the top or bottom of the screen will do the work of the Stream and Path buttons:  left to right at top for advance in Stream, vice versa to move backward; left to right at bottom to advance on Path, and vice versa.
</p><p>
Of course, the ultimate interface to the <em>Victory Garden</em> database is the World Wide Web, with its standards and practices.  You can use the regular features of your web browser to retrace the steps of your reading or interrogate your history.  Should you be minded to delve into the workings, page code and associated scripts and data are all available if you know how to find them.  You might even be able to discover that famously unlinked page. Happy wandering.
