<h1>Talkin' 'bout the Horror</h1>

<p>— —</p>
<p>Extinction.</p>

<p>Nada-dada, the one final absence that is not presence, the net unwoven, the cycle permanently unspun.  It's the terror of a one-way world, of riding time's arrow all the way and finding yourself out of time, out of answers, out of questions even.</p>

<p>This is the monster in the closet, this is what's back of the terror of the night, the meaning of <a class="textlink"  href="Complicated.html">that nasty word</a> we wake screaming so the Ancestor can't breathe it to us when he catches us in the dreaming wood.</p>

<p>So it's <em>one more time</em>  that we sing, <em>get back do it again</em>, <em>bring it on home</em>.  Earnestly we beseech the Lord but keep those engineers funded just in case, watching all the time the power curve, the permanent cycle, praying constantly <em>Please Continue...</em></p>
