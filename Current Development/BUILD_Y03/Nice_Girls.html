<h1>Nice Girls</h1>

<p>
On this November evening the No was showcasing that well-known trio from down in Texas, Two Nice Girls.  They sang:
</p><ul><em>
I spent my last ten dollars on birthcontrol<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and beer</span><br>
My life was so much simpler when I was sober<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and queer<br>
But the love of a strong hairy man has turned my head I fear<br>
And made-me-spend my last-ten-bucks on birthcontrol<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and beer.
</em></ul>
You could tell this was going over well because most of the crowd in the No actually stopped complaining for a minute.  The women began to smile.  A couple of them sang along.
