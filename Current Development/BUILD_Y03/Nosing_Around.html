<h1>Nosing Around</h1>

<p>Jude watched her fingers riffle over the file tabs, peeling back the headings.  She had only the vaguest idea what she might be looking for.  She was relying not on sight and judgement but on a more primitive set of senses â€” intuition, touch, the tools of the huntress.  Laugh if you want.</p>

<p>Title IV Reports.  Legislative Liaison.  Budgetary Summaries 1985-89.  EEOC/AA.  Security Reviews.  <a class="textlink"  href="Caller.html">Heidel Report</a>, hmm.  Interesting but not what she came for.</p>

<p>Jude switched drawers, still browsing.  Nowhere, nothing.  So she closed her eyes and stopped looking, and it was in this way that she made her discovery.  Actually she smelled it.</p>

<p>Cigar smoke.  Scotch whisky.  She put her face close to the drawer and let her nose take her to the folder she wanted.</p>
