<h1>A Good Question</h1>

<p>Urquhart won't say anything for a while, he'll just sit there smoking.  Here it is, Victor will realize, another one of his insufferable Dramatic Pauses.</p>

<p>Just to prove he can't be so easily manipulated, Victor will go inside and take a pee, make himself a tahini sandwich, watch the Weather Channel for a while.</p>

<p>Then he'll come back out and find Urquhart still there, the only indicator of time being the pile of ash between his feet and the relative shortness of his cheroot.</p>

<p>I'm sleeping with her, Victor will tell him.</p>

<p>Urquhart will take the cigar and grind it out slowly, with Teutonic precision.</p>

<p>What do you suppose that means? he'll ask.</p>
