<h1>Opinions</h1>
<tt>
<p>Which is to beg the question of <a class="textlink"  href="By_the_Way_.html">what we want to get done</a> over here.  Hard to say for sure, you've got lots of opinions.  Everybody is pretty clear about the Oil, including yrs truly.  You can talk all you want about how the C*I*A put Saddam together in their spare time, you still can't see him owning 1/3 of the world's petroluem reserves.  Not if you care about having a job when you get back to the world.</p>

<p>Beyond that, some of these BOYS wouldn't mind nuking Badgag just for drill (well only with TACTICAL stuff, OK).  I guess most of us hope what we're doing comes down to a standoff, tho how long could that last.  I don't even want to think.</p>

<p>Anyway, I spose you'd have to say what that reporter said about the Vietnam â€” the only kind of position you can have ON the thing is your position IN it.  Still true today.</p>
