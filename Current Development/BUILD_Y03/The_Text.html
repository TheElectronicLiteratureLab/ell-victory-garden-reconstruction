<h1>The Text</h1>

<p>"Which brings us to our text for tonight," Macarthur threw in, knowing the segu√© was lame but going for it anyway.  "A story about espionage and detection.  A tale of murder and communication, coincidence and crossed identities.  A narrative essay on necessity and the nature of time."</p>

<p>"Garbage," Victor sniped.  "Drivel.  The Garden of Forking Bullshit.  More like totally unnecessary and a huge<em>waste</em>  of time.  I think <a class="textlink"  href="Timely.html">Urquhart</a> is afraid to show up because he might have to hear how stupid his reading list is."</p>

<p>"At least Victor is consistent," Amanda observed.  "He hates everything."</p>

<p>"I dunno," Jude Busch confessed.  "I thought the story <a class="textlink"  href="About_Time.html">sucked</a>, too."</p>

<p>"Aw, gee," said <a class="textlink"  href="East.html">Macarthur</a>.</p>
