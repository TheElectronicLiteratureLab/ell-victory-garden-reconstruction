<h1>The Love You Take</h1>

<p>Jude stared up at the crazy light, thinking it over.  The answer wasn't as plain as it might once have seemed.</p>

<p>She'd wanted something for herself and she'd wanted to prove something to him.  Now she wasn't sure what she'd proved and she suspected that what she'd got was not quite what she'd desired in the first place.</p>

<p>She thought some more, feeling drowsy and a little drunk, until a thought finally came into focus.</p>

<p>"Did you love Emily?" she asked him.</p>

<p>"Very, very much," he answered.  At which point their last candle went dark.</p>

<p>"I did too."</p>
