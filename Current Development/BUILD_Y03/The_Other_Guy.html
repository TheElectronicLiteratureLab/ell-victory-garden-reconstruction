<h1>The Other Guy</h1>

<p>Dexter stretched out, trying three or four increasingly awkward positions before he convinced himself there was no such thing as comfort in a chemical warfare suit.  "Say Whizzer," he said finally, "you remember those old commercials about defensive driving â€” the ones that said 'Watch Out For The Other Guy?'"</p>

<p>"Yeah, they were rich.  We know<em>you're</em>  okay, but that sucker in the next lane, uh oh."</p>

<p>"Right," Dexter agreed.  "What I could never figure out was, if the commercial is meant for all of us, then who the fuck is this Other Guy?"</p>

<p>"Hang it up, Dex.  The Army don't need philosophers."  The Whizzer fumbled in his pack for a cube of nicotine gum.  Like a few thousand of his fellow desert troopers, he was rethinking his dependencies.</p>

<p>"The thing is, I think I finally know who the Other Guy is," Dexter went on.</p>
