<h1>Statement</h1>

<p>"Thanks kindly, stranger," Billy Van said, letting out the slippery clutch.  "We'd offer you a ride but they's a bunch of us in here as 'tis."  He paused a few feet further on.  "An' anyways we don't give rides to no peckerwood <em>faggots</em> ..."</p>

<p>Somebody tossed a beer bottle in Leroy's general direction and the DisasterBus wallowed into an abrupt turn.  Leroy sprinted after, feeling a spreading numbness in the pit of his stomach.</p>

<p>"C'mon," he heard Billy Van Saxgutter say to his confederates, "we got us a statement to make."</p>

<p>The bus rattled off with a sharp backfire and a belch of burnt oil.</p>
