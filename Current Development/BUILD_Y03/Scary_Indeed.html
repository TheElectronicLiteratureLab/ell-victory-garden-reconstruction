<h1>Scary Indeed</h1>

<p>"Scary?" Harley wondered, momentarily driven from distraction.</p>

<p>"Yeah.  You know how I see shapes and colors when it happens to me?  Well, Emily says she sees her own body.  As if she's outside of it.  As if she's dead."</p>

<p>Harley considered.  "I thought you said she's never â€”"</p>

<p>"She hasn't.  That's just on the way."</p>

<p>"Scary indeed."</p>
