<h1>Your Input</h1>

<p>"Jude Busch is a philosopher, not a hacker," Urquhart told him.  "She's not the type to crack systems.  Try again."</p>

<p>Madden made another note.  "Well okay then.  As always, we appreciate your input."</p>

<p>Urquhart said nothing, just slid into the seat, kicked down the clutch pedal and twisted the key.  The engine shook itself awake.</p>

<p>"I may have to contact you again later," Madden warned, half shouting over the yowl of the exhaust.</p>

<p>Urquhart slipped the parking brake and started to back out, flipping Madden a brief salute.  "I guess so."</p>

<p>Madden waved bye-bye.</p>
