<p>"Papers?" the Whizzer wondered.</p>

<p>"Yeah â€” these real strange release forms.  'I agree not to hold the owners of these premises responsible for any and all bodily harm that may come to me as a result of my voluntary interaction with the aforementioned works of art.'  Something like that."</p>

<p>"Weird shit."</p>

<p>"So we go in and we're in this dark room, I mean <em>real </em> dark, except there's this one spot focused on a little table and chair.  There's this machine of some kind on the table, and when I get closer I just about shit myself cause I see what it is."</p>
