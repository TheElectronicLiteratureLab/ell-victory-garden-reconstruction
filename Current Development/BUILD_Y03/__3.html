<p>THINK ABOUT IT, the Amulet suggests.</p>

<p>So you think about it, and you don't have to think very long at all.  — Oh.  Oh.  OH.</p>

<p>THAT'S RIGHT.  THE —man— HIMSELF.</p>

<p>— Oh.  Oh.  But waitaminnit here, hold on, break-break: like J.C. Fogarty always says, <em>It ain't me...</em></p>

<p>CAN YOU BE SURE?</p>

<p>— Well, yeah.  Of course I can be sure...</p>

<p>— Aww, no...</p>
