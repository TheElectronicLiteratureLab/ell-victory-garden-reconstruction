<h1>Power Suit</h1>

<p>"Yeah," the Whizzer observed, "with Dexter how can you tell?"</p>

<p>Dexter was performing what looked vaguely like aikido moves beside his bunk.  "Suit time!  Suit time!  Get me some more of that suit time."</p>

<p>"Dexter, what the<em>fuck</em>  are you talking about?" Sergeant Yvonne demanded.</p>

<p>"Love the suit!  This thing is my future.  This is my ace number one career move.  The suit!  You gotta love it."</p>

<p>"Crack his hood before I crack his fuckin' head."</p>

<p>The Whizzer released the seals and peeled back Dexter's headpiece.  "Breathe easy, man."</p>

<p>"I'm telling you, Cheezwhiz, I'm going places in the suit."</p>
