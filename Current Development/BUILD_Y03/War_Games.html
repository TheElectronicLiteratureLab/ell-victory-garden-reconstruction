<h1>War Games</h1>

<tt>

<p>I thought you were wrong to go, Emily, and I still do, though I never asked if you'd considered <a class="textlink"  href="Look_in_the_Mirror.html">alternatives</a>.  Why was that?  I must have talked to a half dozen students who said they wouldn't go.  But not you, kiddo.  You knew what you wanted.  Get the job done, you said.</p>

<p>It's the last thing I'd ever have said, Emily, but you never sounded unsure.  You knew.  Get the job done, you say.  Do your bit and come home.</p>

<p>But the job is immoral, evil, and wrong.  It means willingly taking part in their war games, their killing machines.  I can't believe</p>

<p>This is such SHit...</p>
