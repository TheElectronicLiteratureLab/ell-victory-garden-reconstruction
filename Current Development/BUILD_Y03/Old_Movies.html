<h1>Old Movies</h1>

<p><a class="textlink"  href="JSN.html">Leroy</a> rolled his eyes.  "But my mind's real confused, Mom.  You and Dad never have trouble with politics.  You know where you stand â€” it all goes back to that big decade of yours.  Your sixties.  But it's not so easy for a kid right now."</p>

<p>She studied him in plain astonishment.  Where did all this soul-searching come from?  Wasn't he supposed to be self-contained and arrogant and degree-zero cynical?  Didn't he watch <em>The Simpsons</em>?  Such an improbable boy.</p>

<p>"Jeez, I feel so ignorant," Leroy went on.  "When you say 'war' all I can think of is old movies.  <em>Star Wars</em>  and 
<em>Platoon</em>  and <a class="textlink"  href="Unseen.html"><em>Hamburger Hill</em>.</a>"</p>

<p>Yes, yes, she thought,  old movies.  Five, ten, fifteen years, practically his whole lifetime.  <a class="textlink"  href="Do_Something.html">Old movies</a>.  <em>All Quiet on the Western Front</em>.  <em>Sands of Iwo Jima</em>.  <a class="textlink"  href="Political_Correction.html"><em>Bedtime for Bonzo</em>.</a></p>
