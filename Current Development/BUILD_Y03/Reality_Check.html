<h1>Reality Check</h1>

<p>Hard to take such claims seriously.  As we've all been taught, nature abhors a conspiracy and, well, shit just happens.  Get back in line and stop that thinking, you'll work yourself into some kind of social disease.</p>

<p>Okay, so it wasn't Sununu and Fitzwater drawing those pentagrams down in the White House Paranoia Room, calling up Hoover's ghost to seal their curse on the head of Kenneth.  <a class="textlink"  href="This_Didn_t_Happen.html">That didn't happen</a>.</p>

<p>The Fact Is there's <a class="textlink"  href="Rather_Not.html">no need to invent conspiracy theories</a>.  Get out your Occam's Razor and slice away.  Seems that NBC lost $55 million covering the Gulf war, CBS's losses for the year may come to five or six times that.  With balance sheets like these, who needs enemies?</p>
