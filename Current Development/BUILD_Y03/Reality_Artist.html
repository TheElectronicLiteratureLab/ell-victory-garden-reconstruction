<p>I think about this for a minute.  "But this virtual reality of yours, it's something you can control?"</p>

<p>He sat up.  "It's something you can <a class="textlink"  href="Work.html">work</a> with."</p>

<p>I am watching the joggers.  Thaïs is the one I fancy.  Thaïs of the lyrelike hips.  She looks our way as she goes past, smiles and cocks an eyebrow.</p>

<p>"But if you can control this fantasy world," I say, forcing myself back to the conversation, "then surely others can too.  Aren't you worried about, what did you call them, the <a class="textlink"  href="Buildup.html">Suits</a>?"</p>

<p>Leroy waved to Thaïs and stuck out his lower lip dismissively.  "What do Suits know?  That's the whole point of being a <a class="textlink"  href="Tate_Reboots.html">reality artist</a>."</p>
