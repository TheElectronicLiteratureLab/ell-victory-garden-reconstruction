<h1>Urquhart's Answer</h1>

<p>Urquhart decided he would look into the patch of darkness.  It was easier than looking into the harsh light.  So he looked into the unilluminated night and he was amazed at what he saw there.</p>

<p>"Boris fella," Harley said from outside the car, "I really think you should be doing what they want.  Are you listening?"</p>

<p>REMAIN WHERE YOU ARE.  PUT YOUR HANDS ON YOUR HEAD AND DO NOT MOVE.</p>

<p>Off to Urquhart's right the wedge of darkness framed a bit of meadow and a limestone hummock.  At the top of this little rise was a familiar building, whitewashed with streaks of rust.  Classic in its design, a slotted dome.  The old observatory. <em>The answer to everything</em>.</p>
