<h1>What U Know</h1>

<p>Listening to those voices in his head... </p>

<p>I AM A SCIENTIST EMILY YOU KNOW THAT ABOUT ME.  No visionary, no mystic, no shaman, just the Scientist, the Man In The White Suit, what do you know about that?  What can anyone know about anything?  O man, spare us these Questions.  </p>

<p><a class="textlink"  href="The_White_Suit.html">Knowledge</a> arises out of complex discursive transactions: we make it up as we make it up, more-than-half-creating what we perceive... </p>

<p>Two reels deep in the Return of the Twilight of the Idols, and what we know above all is that we are but shadows here, poor players.  </p>

<p>But really, folks...</p>
