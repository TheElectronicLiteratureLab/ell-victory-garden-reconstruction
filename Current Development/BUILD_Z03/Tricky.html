<h1>Tricky</h1>

<p>Doing it as prescribed, keeping the badge handy but leaving his reach hand free, Madden grasped the handle of the garage door, thinking it was surely locked down or wired to an automatic opener; though you never knew, it was worth a try.</p>

<p>The door flew up.  An antique, and the lock long since broken.  "Boris Urquhart?"</p>

<p>"You're Madden.  <a class="textlink"  href="Capitol.html">You know Harley</a>."</p>

<p>"I'm with the Bureau, and this is business."  He flashed the badge and stepped inside, sizing up the situation â€” which was tricky enough all right.  Those shades and that beret, now what was supposed to make of them?  He knew full well <a class="textlink"  href="Something_Happens.html">what they probably meant</a>.  True there was no hard proof, and the beefs involved were local matters, nothing above a misdemeanor, certainly nothing Federal.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Urquhart was cleared Top Secret.  For the moment.</p>
