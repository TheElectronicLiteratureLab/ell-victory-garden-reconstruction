<h1>Polaroid</h1>

<p>The thing is, Thea, strange as his behavior always is, lately he seems to be slipping over the edge even by his own standards.  I mean, what am I supposed to make of this Polaroid he sends me with him standing in front of the freaking Iraqi flag?  Dressed up in these designer desert fatigues with a revolver stuck in his web belt.  And holding, of all things, some kind of old carbine.  </p>

<p>You know the guy (and have for a lot longer than I have).  It's some kind of political statement, I know.  I suspect he's not real happy about my being here.  Ho ho, very funny Boris.</p>

<p>Anyway, I'd appreciate if, <strong>if its not too much trouble</strong>, if you could reassure me about his sanity, or else maybe get him set up in some nice institution.  Gotta be one that allows conjugal visits, that's all I ask.</p>
