<h1>Missing</h1>

<p>Emily sniffed the hooch and tried to pretend that it didn't smell an awful lot like acetone.  "Okay, so let's lighten up.  Think about back in the world.  Think about sweet home.  Tell me what you miss the most."</p>

<p>Sergeant Yvonne giggled.  "That one is <em>dead</em>  simple."  Emily rolled her eyes.  </p>

<p>"Now come on, Miss College Degree," the Sergeant chided, "you got those feelings too, I know you do.  You a good ol' material girl even if you do look like that cold-ass bitch <a class="textlink"  href="Sisters.html">Muriel Streep</a>.  You gotta miss that thing just like we all do.  But I don't mean just the strokin' and pokin,' at least not all by itself."</p>

<p>Emily took another drink in hopes that it would kill the burn in her throat, but it only made it worse.  "I know," she said.  "I miss being touched.  I miss being held."</p>
