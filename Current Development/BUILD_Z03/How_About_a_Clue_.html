<h1>How About a Clue?</h1>


<p>
"In hypertext parlance, a Jane's Space is part of a hypertext that you can't find in the usual, link-following way.  A Web page that's not linked to your site and that's hidden from the search engines is a Jane's space; you can only get there if you happen to know the URL. ... I recently wrote a small program that scans Storyspace documents, looking for spaces with text but no inbound links.  Of 28 published hypertexts, at least 16 appear to have Jane's spaces.  I knew some of these, but the overall total seems extraordinarily high."
