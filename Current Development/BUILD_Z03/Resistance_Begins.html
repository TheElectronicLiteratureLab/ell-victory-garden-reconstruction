<h1>Resistance Begins</h1>

<p>"No, I won't support a war if it comes to that," <a class="textlink"  href="Veronica_s_Party.html">Veronica</a> was saying.  "And I don't agree with my sister's decision to go, but I respect it because I respect her."</p>

<p>"That's naive at best," the man leaning on the refrigerator told her.  She thought his name was Myron something and he seemed to be a friend of her ex-roommate Holly, but who could be sure?  "The <a class="textlink"  href="Rock_of_Faith.html">war machine</a> is a universal fact of existence in the so-called modern world," Myron Something held forth.  "We're all implicated, so by their own totalizing logic, we're also all empowered.  To subvert the motherfuckers."</p>

<p>"Bean dip," Veronica remembered.  "I knew I came in here for something."</p>

<p>"Opposition to war is everyone's responsibility," Myron persisted, "on a personal as well as a political level.  Resistance begins at home."</p>
