<p>"...and I imagine the two of us going at it," Dexter went on, "right down there on the floor, just a-haulin' and ballin' and gettin' right into it, these two suits all tangled up in a kind of big plastic knot..."</p>

<p>"I dunno, Dex, I don't think <em>Forum</em>  will take this one," the Whizzer judged.</p>

<p>"...and then you know here come the MP's to break it up and they grab hold and start pawing away but guess what? â€” when they get the suits untangled and undo all the snaps and seals, what do they find?"</p>

<p>"No," Dexter objected, "they don't find anything at all!  We've completely disappeared.  Vanished without a trace, left no forwarding address.  All gone <a class="textlink"  href="Missing.html">home</a>."</p>
