<h1>Quiz</h1>

<p>Madden hauled himself up the steel gangway, trying to go easy in the poor light.</p>

<p>"What do you know about scales of astronomical measurement, Agent Madden?" Tate called down to him.</p>

<p>"Real big numbers," he said.  "They're what you folks around here use for real estate deals."  He paused to catch his breath.  "And bank failures."</p>

<p>Tate tapped some medium-sized numbers into a keypad.  "But I mean 'astronomical' in its literal sense.  For instance, do you have any idea of the ratio between the orbital areas of the earth and the moon?"</p>

<p>Madden made it to the viewing cage only a little the worse for wear.  He dug out his wallet and presented his credentials.  "You'll have to make that one easier, Prof â€” I'm afraid I slept through everything after plane geometry."</p>
