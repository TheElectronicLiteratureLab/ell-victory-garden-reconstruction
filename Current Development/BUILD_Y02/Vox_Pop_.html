<h1>Vox —Pop—</h1>

<p>"Our dream experiments are indeed primitive and limited, gentlemen, but they may also represent a crucial venture in the advancement of human consciousness.  We are attempting to locate and stimulate the mental faculties that allow us to perceive the world not as a singular, linear unfolding, not a closed system or a line of necessity, but rather as a network of possibilities, an <a class="textlink"  href="Slacktown.html">organicity of intersections</a>, parallels, and departures, infinite in its extension and vast in its possibilities for permutation.  If we are successful in this effort, the consequences will be epochal.  Our course lies beyond representation, beyond simulation, beyond any singular or reductive ontology.  We attempt to move outside the constraints of language, history, logic, even consciousness as we now experience it."</p>
