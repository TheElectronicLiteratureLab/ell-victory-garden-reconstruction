<h1>Naming Names</h1>

<p>"Just out of idle curiosity, who are we talking about here?" Madden inquired.</p>

<p>Heidel had his <a class="textlink"  href="Exhuming_McCarthy.html">index</a> ready to go.  "Berkowitz in Sociology, Sanchez-Ochoa of Hispanic Cultures, <a class="textlink"  href="Scare.html">Agnew</a> and most of her curricular revision committee, including that nut case <a class="textlink"  href="Computer_Reads_Dreams_.html">Boris Urquhart</a> from Simulated Science or whatever they call themselves."</p>
<a class="textlink"  href="Cybercrimes.html"></a>
<p>This last item did ring a bell, if not an actual alarm.  Madden made a mental note.  "I think it's called the Center for Virtual Realities."  A group — and a name — that had recently come to his attention.</p>

<p>"Whatever."</p>

<p>Madden turned on a medium-heavy stare.  "The Center does a fair amount of SDI work," he observed.</p>
