<h1>On the Board</h1>

<p>Jude opened and read, flicking the pages rapidly, not really knowing what she'd find but knowing this was it.  And what she found was good, very good.</p>

<p>It was a file of business correspondence between the President, Laurence M. Stanley, and the firm of Maddox, Harrow, and Stone, who represented a firm called GreensCorp.  Mr. Stanley had been invited to join the GreensCorp board.  Which was where things got interesting.</p>

<p>GreensCorp was an oddly diversified set of holdings.  Oilfields and drilling services, copper mining interests in Southeast Asia, a shopping mall in Houston, and a large portfolio of sunbelt real estate, chiefly luxury golf-course condominiums.</p>

<p>Including the proposed <a class="textlink"  href="On_the_Board_1.html">Whitman's Creek project</a>.  Well, well.</p>
