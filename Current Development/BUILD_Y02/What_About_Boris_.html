<h1>What About Boris?</h1>

<p>"What about me?" Urquhart asked.</p>

<p>"Well to start with, you're a scientist.  I know the distinction bothers you, I know <a class="textlink"  href="Absence_of_Boris.html">you care</a> about things like culture and representation and literacy, but you're off in your research center playing Star Wars <a class="textlink"  href="Name_That_Game.html">games</a>, why should you bother with the Humanities curriculum?"</p>

<p>He looked at her over the rim of his shades.  "Maybe I want to change the world too."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>He stubbed out his cigar, trying to bring his thoughts to sharper focus.  "Because <a class="textlink"  href="Forfeit.html">it can be different</a>.  Because it... <em>needs</em>   to be."</p>

<p>A little smile came to her face.  "You were born <a class="textlink"  href="1975_Facts.html">too late</a>."</p>
