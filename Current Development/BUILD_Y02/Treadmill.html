<p>The representatives of the Program Komiteh take you by the wrists and start dragging you along this rapidly moving treadway and suddenly you're in the United Airlines transit tunnel at O'Hare though the roof here seems to be a stained plexiglass mural of scenes from the illustrious career of Spiro T. Agnew, see here he is with brown bags of cash from Maryland contractors clutched in his fists, and there he is with Adnan Khashoggi closing that deal to sell military uniforms to Iraq and there he is smiling in the background as RMN shakes hands with the King and —<em>waitaminute</em> — isn't this thing moving kind of fast?  The wind whips through your hair as the treadmill exceeds 35 mph.</p>
