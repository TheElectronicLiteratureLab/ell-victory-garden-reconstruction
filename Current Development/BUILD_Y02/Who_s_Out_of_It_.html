<h1>Who's Out of It?</h1>

<p>Better question, though — <a class="textlink"  href="Do_Something.html">how can you be OUT of this situation?</a>  Is that why you're not writing, Thea?  Is it because you think this is a diffrent place somehow, one that doesn't plug into Sweet Home Tara?  Have I fallen off the map as far as you're concerned, am I wandering in the wilderness?  Would you rather not think about it?  </p>

<p>Think again, dearie.  This ain't no <a class="textlink"  href="Forbidden_Planet.html">alien planet</a>, tho I admit it sometimes looks that way.  Its just the other side of the same old world.  Everything was still <a class="textlink"  href="Paraknowledge.html">connected</a> last time I looked.</p>

<p>I'm an American, look at me, <a class="textlink"  href="Resistance_.html">G.I. Jane</a>. <a class="textlink"  href="I_m_OK.html">Scary</a>, isn't it.  But guess what — you're an American too and what we do over here we're doing as much in your name as mine.  How bout I put your picture on my helmet, ha ha.</p>
