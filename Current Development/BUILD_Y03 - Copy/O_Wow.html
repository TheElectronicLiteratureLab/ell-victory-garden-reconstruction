</strong><em> </em><em>
<p>And now here are your captain and first officer, Winslow Pardee of Lubbock, Texas and Lubbock Winslow of Pardee, Texas... they'd just like you to shake their hand before they execute their Daring Leap for Life from the rear hatchway!  Folks, howbout a round of applause for our captains courageous and a rousing Bronx cheer for the man who made today's horror necessary — </em>Mister Kenneth Q. Macarthur of 397-99 Park Slope Avenue in Brooklyn, New York!<strong> </p>
