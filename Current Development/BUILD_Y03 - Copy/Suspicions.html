<h1>Suspicions</h1>

<p>"Okay, second and final question," Madden said.  "Do you know an undergraduate student named Judith Sloan Busch?"</p>

<p>Urquhart thought about it, then nodded.  "I direct her senior research project."</p>

<p>"And does that project involve access to secure time-sharing systems?"</p>

<p>"Of course not, and that was a third question."</p>

<p>Madden shrugged.  "Guess I lost count." Madden jotted a short note on his steno pad.  "So you have no reason to believe that Ms. Busch may be involved in network security violations?"</p>

<p>Urquhart opened the door of the Porsche, then turned to face Madden.  He took off his shades and gave him his hardest look straight on.  Madden was used to it.</p>
