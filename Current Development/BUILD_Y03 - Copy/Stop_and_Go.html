<h1>Stop and Go</h1>

<p>Urquhart looked down the length of East Main, counting three lights dead ahead, 20th, 24th, 26Ë†th.  All cycling now to amber.  He checked the rearview and saw two cars behind him, an old green pickup and a blue Mercury.  Short on trim, aggressively ordinary, entirely too official: the fabled Unmarked Car.  He glanced back again as the Mercury passed a streetlight and saw the big head above the steering wheel, watched the driver brush his forelock back from his eyes.  Madden.</p>

<p>The lights ahead were red now.  Urquhart swung into the left lane about a hundred yards from 20th.  He couldn't say where he was going or what he was going to do.  It would come to him, or he to it.  <em>Remain in motion.  Move through the night.</em></p>

<p>The lights were red.  Urquhart had the clutch in but he hadn't touched the brake.  He was going about 25 coming up to the stop line.  He hesitated a moment, rolling through the crosswalk, slowing slightly on the upgrade as he entered the intersection.  There was no traffic.</p>
