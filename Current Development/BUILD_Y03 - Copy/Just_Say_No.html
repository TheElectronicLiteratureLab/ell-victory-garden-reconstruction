<h1>Just Say No</h1>

<p>"For generations," Urquhart began with strained patience, "philosophers, poets, mystics, and your odd physicist have dreamed about alternatives to linear and determinate ontologies."</p>

<p>"Bah," Weinburger said.</p>

<p>"You don't really exist, sir," Urquhart told him, whereupon Weinburger vanished with a satisfying —pop— like the sound of a defective lightbulb.  Urquhart carried on.</p>

<p>"With the creation of interactive electronics and virtual environments, all that hyper-cyber-what-you-will, we stand at last on the threshold of true Alternative Realities."</p>
