<h1>Thea's War</h1>

<p>The war came to Dorothea Agnew as a great shock, a sudden tidal surge of reality.  In spite of herself she had begun to think of the business in the Gulf as a kind of relief.  It reminded people of a larger world beyond the university, the city, and even the Commonwealth of <a class="textlink"  href="Tara.html">Tara</a> â€” which took some of the heat off <a class="textlink"  href="Scare.html">her own case</a>.</p>

<p>But now it had all come literally home, right into her living room.  She and <a class="textlink"  href="Sisters.html">Veronica Runbird</a> knelt like little kids too close to the screen, listening to all those grave male voices and trying, between the two of them, to feel their way toward sense.</p>

<p>So much of it seemed contrived, spectacular.  She kept telling herself it was <a class="textlink"  href="Unseen.html">only a movie</a>, except it seemed to be another David Lynch film, a cinema of angst and delusion.  The night was full of unfunny jokes.  She was seeing a report on military intelligence delivered by a wannabe tough guy named "<a class="textlink"  href="The_Color_Guys.html">Wolf Blitzer</a>."  What did it mean?  Had there been a coup de tube by the World Wrestling Federation?  Would the cameras cut now to Atlanta to show <a class="textlink"  href="This_Didn_t_Happen.html">Hulk Hogan</a> at the anchor desk?</p>
