<h1>Telephone</h1>

<p>On the very twitch of midnight Thea's telephone began to ring.  Thea didn't move.  She didn't even hear the first ring, or if she did, she gave no response.</p>

<p>In the darkened house the phone rang again.</p>

<p>It might have been a friendly call from someone on the Committee, or from Harley or Miles Macarthur or even Urquhart; it might have been any number of old friends from back east calling to share the war shock; it might have been just a wrong number.  But somehow Thea was convinced this call would be none of the above.  Some deeper sense told her this call was trouble.</p>
