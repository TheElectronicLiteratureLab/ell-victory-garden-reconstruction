<p>Thea sought in vain for a book of matches and finally Urquhart fished a lighter out of his pocket and tossed it over.  "When did you start smoking?" she wondered.</p>

<p>He held up a leather cigar case.  "Old habit from my Dartmouth days.  <a class="textlink"  href="Some_Scene.html">Cheroots</a>."</p>

<p>Thea tried to light up but her hand wouldn't stop twitching.  Urquhart leaned over to help out.  "Lie to me," he said, "tell me that's just from too much coffee."</p>

<p>"I could say it's from my asshole friend breaking into my office," Thea replied, "but that would be lying too."</p>
