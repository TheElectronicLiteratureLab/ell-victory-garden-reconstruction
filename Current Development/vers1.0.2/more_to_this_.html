<h1>more to this...</h1>

<p>"How calm everything looks," Koppel muses.  "It looks like <a class="textlink"  href="Treadmill.html">O'Hare</a> or J.F.K."</p>
<p>It looked like a portrait of  a stickup gang from the 1930's.  The men wore pinstripe suits and leather jackets and stared at the camera with a sort of vague canine menace.  In elder days this was called a Triumph, with captives led in chains behind the hero's car.  But there are no chains and no prisoners here.  This is America and everyone is free.</p>

<p>"Sounds like there's more to this story."</p>
<p>"There is."</p>
<p><em>You took that oath, and you took it seriously.  And when you did that, so far as I'm concerned, you sold out yourself â€” along with the rest of us who'd like to think that having a hard dick or a loaded gun doesn't give you the right to push the rest of the world around.</em></p>

<p>This is such SHit...</p>
