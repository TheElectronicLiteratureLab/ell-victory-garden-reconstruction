<p>Leonard the airmobile munchkin zips back around a corner <em>zziinnng</em>  and says — You'll be needing this now.</p>

<p>— Whuzzis? you're wondering as he drops what you'll be needing over your head.</p>

<p>AMULET OF HIGHER UNDERSTANDING MODEL XGS-47 A PRODUCT OF XANALOGICS INTERCOSMIC PATENT PENDING.</p>

<p>— Well, yeah, I knew that.</p>

<p>You're holding the Amulet in your left palm.  It reminds you of something from the Seventies.  Either mood rings or blotter acid.  Maybe both.  It changes colors a lot and it puts strange words in your head.  Yeah. </p>
