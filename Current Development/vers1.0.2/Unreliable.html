<h1>Unreliable</h1>

<p>Gerry Madden knew all about loyalty oaths, background investigations, and Unreliable Persons lists.  He knew even more about them, in fact, than most of his fellow Feds.</p>

<p>Witchhunting was more than history in the Madden family.  It had been so ever since Madden's father, a special investigator for the Commerce Commission in a midwestern state, was pink-slipped (in every sense) in the winter of 1952.  </p>

<p>There was an administrative hearing, during which no material evidence of disloyalty was produced.  But it was noted that the family's name had once been spelled Majdanov, and that a cousin of that name was a high official of the Polish satellite government.</p>

<p>Ten years later, in a different America, the Governor offered Teddy Madden his old job back.  He had a private security business by then and was not inclined to change.</p>
