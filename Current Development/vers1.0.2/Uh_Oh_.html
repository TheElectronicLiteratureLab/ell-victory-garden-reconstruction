<h1>Uh Oh...</h1>

<p>Now this was where the real trouble started.  </p>

<p>One minute Billy Van Saxgutter was down in the back of the bus having himself a fine old time tearing out handfuls of that leftist-liberal upholstery while siphoning off a fresh can of beer.  The next thing he knew he was sitting there trying to keep his pants dry in the face of certain death.</p>

<p>It seems somehow the Rainbow Bus had come aflame.</p>

<p>Billy Van saw smoke seeping out of the headliner a few feet away and tried frantically spraying it with beer foam.  This was not especially useful.  Up on the balcony Thea spotted the first tongues of flame curling over the roof of the bus.  She dragged Veronica to the floor with her and started crawling toward the telephone.</p>

<p>"If that thing goes up we'll be fucking barbecued."</p>
