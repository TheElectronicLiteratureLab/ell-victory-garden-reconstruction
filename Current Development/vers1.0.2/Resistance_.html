<h1>Resistance?</h1>

<p>Veronica was quiet, thinking back over the last few hours, what she'd seen and done at the <a class="textlink"  href="JSN.html">No</a>.  She thought about the blank faces, the focused passivity, the inertia.  </p>

<p>And then she remembered dropping Emily off at the Reserve center a few months back.  She remembered seeing her own sister in G.I. Jane camo drag, watching her heft her pack, wave goodbye, march away.  Her own sister now somewhere around the curve of the earth where day was night, doing her bit, making sure the flyers and tank drivers and grunts got their <a class="textlink"  href="From_a_Hot_Place.html">letters from home</a>.</p>
