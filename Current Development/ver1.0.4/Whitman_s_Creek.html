<h1>Whitman's Creek</h1>

<p>Forget the majestic Capitol of the Taran Commonwealth (which is really just the Washington model done over in Santa Fe pink); forget the exquisite Spanish baroque of the University, forget the historic Trewhitt Hotel, where in a spirit of western cussedness the Fathers of the Commonwealth maintained their independence for most of the summer of 1848; forget the famous bat-infested Fourth Street Bridge and the burgeoning semiconductor corridor of the R&D Freeway; forget the gridiron action of the Battling Sidewinders, the sailing and windsurfing on Congress Lake, and the hundred and one golf courses of the West Hills; forget the nightlife, the fine Mexican eateries and barbecue pits of the south side, the East Main drag with its honkytonks and beer joints; and while you're at it, all right,  go ahead and forget the Just Say No Café.</p>

<p>Leaving aside all these considerable attractions, there is still one great inducement to visit the capitol city of Tara — that gorgeous jewel of nature we call Whitman's Creek.</p>
