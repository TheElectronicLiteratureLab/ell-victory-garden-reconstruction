<h1>Tate Reboots</h1>

<p>You find the nearest rheostat and twist it till the room dims down to near blackness.  This takes Tate by surprise and he's caught up in the state-change algorithm, before he knows what's going on he's been redefined down to a nearly immobile pair of eyes.</p>

<p>— Dirty trick, Tate protests, trying furiously to invoke a subroutine.</p>

<p>You allow your palm to linger over the switch.  — Don't tempt me.  Now what was that about a mysterious speaker?</p>

<p>Tate winks his left eye three times.  — ESCAPE-PF13? he tries.  Command-period?</p>

<p>— Talk, you insist.</p>

<p>— <em>CONTROL-ALT-DELETE!</em>   he cries and vanishes in a flash of blue light.</p>
