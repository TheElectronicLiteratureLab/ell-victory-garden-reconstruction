<h1>The Other Us</h1>

<p>"Lemme guess â€” Saddam Hussein?  Dan Quayle?  Rodney Dangerfield?  Or could it be that state trooper you think's been bangin' your old girlfriend?"</p>

<p>Dexter shook his head in sublime disregard.  "It's none other than you and me."</p>

<p>"Gee, how original."</p>

<p>"Laugh but it's true.  Look, the Other Guy isn't just the one that fucks up, he's the one all the shit happens to.  The one that gets herpes and tax audits.  The guy whose trailer is always in the path of the funnel cloud.  The one gets clipped at Burger King when some burnout grabs an assault rifle."</p>

<p>"So?  I don't live in no trailer."</p>

<p>Dexter gave this unhealthy giggle.  "The fuck you don't.  Examine your surroundings."</p>
