<h1>Talking Tate</h1>

<p>"We'll stipulate that Boris has some problems," Harley tossed out for openers.</p>

<p>"I think he's just plain gone round the bend," Tate said flatly.  "The poor boy is <em>loco in cabeza</em>."  He looked around the room.  "But who am I to talk, having invited five thousand people below the age of majority to celebrate on my front lawn while I strut around dressed for the last act of <em>Hamlet</em>.  Here I sit with a man in a motorized ape suit, a woman wearing her enemy's face on her pudenda, and at least one cross-dressing pop-singer-impersonator."  Tate didn't know if Harley was supposed to be Michael Jackson, or if Michael Jackson was supposed to be a man.  He paused, letting the facts settle in.  "I am mindful that academic culture tolerates a great deal of unusual and even erratic behavior as the concomitant of creativity.  I am also reminded by the University's general counsel that distinguishing madness from mere eccentricity can be notoriously hard for those in our line of work."</p>

<p><em>"Talk</em> that talk," Thea said. </p>
