<h1>What Should I Do?</h1>

<p>"If there really is a war," Leroy proposed, "what should I do?"</p>

<p>Thea gave him an odd look.  What kind of question was that?  "Well, you can't vote for another twenty-eight months.  Also there's no draft.  Doesn't that pretty much limit your direct involvement?  Count yourself lucky, is what you can do."</p>

<p>Leroy stared at her.  "Is that what you would have done when you were my age?"</p>

<p>She thought about it.  "Touch√©."  </p>
