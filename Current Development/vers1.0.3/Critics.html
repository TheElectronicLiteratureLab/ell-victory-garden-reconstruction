<h1>Critics</h1>

<p>"Say, Billy Van," one of the Omegas remarked from somewhere in the back.  "Won't those <a class="textlink"  href="Rainbow.html">Rainbow</a> Riders be a little, uh, put out when they find out somebody jacked their bus?"</p>

<p>Billy Van <a class="textlink"  href="Polemicist.html">Saxgutter</a> reached up to adjust his bandana, using both hands so as to get it right.  "Aw heck no, fella."  The bus swayed eagerly toward the divider but Billy Van swatted it back into line, muttering something about fucking slackers who put off their safety inspections.  "I mean, those Rainbow Riders appear to be all commensalists or whatever, so, y'know, property <em>is</em> theft."</p>

<p>"Yeah," a second Omega put in from still further in the back.  "What kinda band was that anyhow?  Two hours of Clash and k.d. lang covers?  A-at an Omega <em>house party</em>?"  There was a chorus of general disapproval.</p>

<p>"All I will say is, they were asking for it in a majorly way."</p>
