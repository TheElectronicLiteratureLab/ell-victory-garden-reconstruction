<h1>What Have We Learned?</h1>

<p>
Well... maybe not much, or not a lot we couldn't have suspected even in less traumatized times.  Which is to say, where the text and its author find themselves two decades deep in the next century is in some ways not that different from pre-Millennial conditions.  Consider this moment from a very <a href='Quiet_Days.html'>late stream</a>:
</p>
<ul><em>

<p>"Heidel resigned," I tell her.  "It was in the <em>Chronicle</em>."</p>

<p>" I saw it."</p>

<p>Then she'll also have seen <a href="Doing_My_Best.html">where he's going</a>: Poland, Czechoslovakia, the Baltics, a special faculty exchange endowed by the Braithwaite Fund.  Sharing the Vision.  The true West rescues the benighted East from its <a href="_disClamor_.html">errors</a>.</p>

<p>"Like the song says," Thea muses.  "<a href="West_End.html">Tomorrow belongs to me</a>."</p>
</ul></em>

<p>
Reversing the vector of supposed enlightenment (or anti-Enlightenment), see the 2022 Conservative Political Action Conference and its "illiberally" extramural venue.  Or this:

<p>
...which is admittedly a fiction, deep fake with depth of field. Or seen another way, collage-logic of personal truth. Another scene in the Garden.  Flaming swords, tiki torches.  Available light.
</p>

<p>
In the old story the Garden is all about ignorant innocence, a timeless dispensation.  Knowing nothing but God, the first couple could not know what was coming: the before time was before time.  Similarly, 1991 was beforetimes with respect to many things: the second Bush regime, 9/11 and the ensuing wars of reprisal, the re-skinning of the state from National to Homeland Security -- and two terms of an African-American presidency, to be sure.  But meanwhile
<a href="What_It_Is_Today.html">other trends</a> held generally constant:
</p>

<ul><em>
<p>About a week before the war began, the Census Bureau reported that the wealth of the most affluent fifth of Americans grew 14% during the eighties while the wealth of the remaining four-fifths remained static.</p>

<p>The median net worth of white families was $<a href="Pay_Per_State.html">43,280</a>.</p>
<p>The median net worth of black families was $<a chref="Bounty.html">4,170</a>.</p>

<p>29% of black households reported that they had no wealth.</p>
<p>29% of white households reported wealth in excess of $100,000.</p>

<p>1% of households controlled one-third of the wealth.</p>
</ul></em>

<p>
The race gap is roughly the same at this writing.  The one-percenter share is closer to 40%.  Don't say nothing changes.
</p><p>
Once upon a time, all art (and life) aspired to the condition of video.  <em>Everything now, in its own way, wants to be television,</em> Greg Ulmer began his Teletheory.  Arguably we'd put that differently now.  For starters, "television" has taken on new meaning.  The change was already underway in the nineties, tracking the rise of news-as-spectacle in developments like ABC's <em>Nightline</em> ("America Held Hostage: Day 11,351") and the relegation of news operations to the entertainment division.  Oh, <a href="Freak_Whence_He.html">Kenneth</a>, whatever was the frequency?  We never found out.
</p><p>
Those salad days of Wolf and Bernie look decidedly quaint, seen against the present videodrome with its red-meat/true-blue binary and its ongoing struggle of Fact versus Alternative Fact.  Outside the nightly combat zone, or Manhattan and D.C. area codes, this warfare probably seems more of the "bush" or "cod" variety.  The on-camera talent may believe they're fighting devils and struggling for the national soul, but the most important conflict lies outside their networks.
</p><p>
"Here's a little thing we call Web Three," as Mr. Burnett might sing in an updated "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK5dNeM4Zls">Humans from Earth</a>."  ("Do you have cryptocurrency?")  These days everything is socially mediated, whether it wants to be or not.  The original <em>Victory Garden</em>, bless its bits, wasn't even Web 1.0, though it may have had certain affinities in that direction.  It was confined to a nine-inch-diagonal, monochrome screen and came on a <em>diskette</em>.  You could hold it in your hand.  You had to.
</p><p>
As the Web came on and its digit counter rolled out new integers, "media" came to refer to things much less discrete: pages algorithmically assembled, "content" meant for sharing on increasingly pervasive screens -- and designed to extract records of behavior which have become the basis for a new, invisible economy.  This is the bounty of "social" -- much less as in ice cream than insects.  Honey from the bees.
</p><p>
Which gets us back, metaphorically and topically, to the Garden and what we may learn by returning.  I will start with a confession.  It has been my avowed policy in this version to leave the writing as it was.  I may occasionally have bent that rule, but in this respect a slothful disposition is a virtue.  Generally I've declined to rewrite, even when the words on the screen induce serious <a href="Paraknowledge.html">CRINGE</a>.  For instance:
<p>
	<ul><em>
		<p>Paranoia...  what does it mean beyond a quaint "sixties" conceit...  maybe due for its <a href="Watch_My_Back.html">comeback</a> like everything else about that jejune decade...  a titillating notion that:</p>

		<p>E˘v˘e˘r˘y˘t˘h˘i˘n˘g-I˘s<a href="Unseen.html">-C˘o˘n˘n˘e˘c˘t˘e˘d˘</a>?</p>

		<p>A sensitivity to patterns, parallels, correspondences.  A <a href="Grass.html">higher</a> scrutiny, in every sense of the word.  Cause-and-effect yes, but also a hint of something far more deeply interfused.</p>

		<p><a href="Have_a_Dream.html">Symmetry</a>, synchronicity... coincidence, <a href="Emergency.html">Chaos</a>?</p>
</em></ul>

<p>
Gah.  Lots of things to regret here.  For starters, using the word "jejune" while committing jejunery.  Also, quoting a certain literary master a few thousand times more than necessary, without the smallest concession to subtlety.  This all looks a lot less like farrago (even) than fanfic.  Which, of course, may not be a distinction you choose to observe.  (Oops, I did it again.)  
</p><p>
But while fanfic might be a noble molehill to die on, that P-word remains fatally problematic -- not because my cusp-middleaged-yet-not-very-grownup self got the hippie-headed prediction wrong, but precisely the opposite.  Because it was all too terribly true.  In at least one respect, the world has proved as brutally simple as my small mind imagined.
</p><p>
It did come back, that P-word -- in the pullulating forms of birth certificate lies, slurs against immigrants and Muslims, pizza-parlor blood libels, smirking Russians in the Oval Office, Sharpie-tracked hurricanes, pandemic denials, bleach-injection fantasies, a madman wilfully spreading virus, tearing off his mask, staring mindlessly into the sun, ginning up insurrection and watching the carnage over KFC.  
The P-word is with us, in all its raw brutality, in all the forms of backlash, the assaults on women's bodies and sexual autonomy, the white supremacist marches and replacement theory and every rifle-assault mass-hanging deathcamp fantasy that ripples behind the increasingly frayed curtains of Q Continuum.
</p><p>
Mainly, of course, we see the P-problem in the great untruth of the moment, the Big Lie about the previous election, serving an obscene assertion of imperial will over popular dignity.  In this moment we may wish to cry, <em>not connected</em> -- that world has no claim on ours -- but to do so seems at best futile, at worst cowardly.  Everything is connected -- disastrously -- and this propinquity seems increasingly apt to burst into conflict.  In this sense our media sociality worsens the problem.  The networks are self-assembling.  The wires run too deep for extraction.
<p>
And you thought the nineties were insane!
</p><p>
Still, there may yet be something to say against all this looming negativity.  Here is another thing we might learn by getting back to the Garden.  At the heart of this fiction is another, older fiction that contains a vision of contingent possibility -- modernism's siren song, perhaps.  The Garden is in only some instances a fatal destination.  There may also be ways through the maze, successful traversals.
</p><p>
In our worst moments, history appears caught in a Tara Timewarp that short-circuits the last three decades, making 2020 may feel precariously like 1920 and "the sixties" more evocative of the 19th than the 20th century.  Yet not all times or timelines are the same.  In some of these unfoldings, the story may be something more than a tale told by an idiot or an error made up by a ghost.  It remains possible, if we understand our agency, to resist or at least manage the seductions of the hivemind, to carom away from the P-word and its nightmares of war and apocalypse.  Possible, though by no means certain.  We need to work at it.  Nothing is guaranteed.  As the man says:
<p><p>
<em>I leave to the various futures (not to all) my garden of forking paths.</em>
