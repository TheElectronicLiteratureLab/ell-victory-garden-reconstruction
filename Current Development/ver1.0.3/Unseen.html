<p>"You have to believe,<a class="textlink"  href="Cyborg_Politics.html"> you'</a>ve gotta have faith," Thea pointed out.  "This isn't going to be any television war, sister.  It's not what you see that matters, but what you won't see.  Press restrictions, pool coverage, censorship."</p>

<p>"Guess we'll have to <a class="textlink"  href="What_Should_I_Do_.html">wait for the movies</a> this time around."</p>
