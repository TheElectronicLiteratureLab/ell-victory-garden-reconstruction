<h1>The Color Guys</h1>

<p>The "military analysts" are perhaps the most bizarre aspect of this whole unreal pageant, a collection of recycled generals and thinktank commanders.  <a class="textlink"  href="Maddening.html">Color Commentators</a>.  </p>

<p>There is the usual American analogy here, <a class="textlink"  href="1001_Arabian_Flights.html">WAR=FOOTBALL</a>.  There is also the cult of expertise, the Best and Brightest Money Can Buy.</p>

<p>CNN brings you <a class="textlink"  href="This_Didn_t_Happen.html">Wolf Blitzer</a>, a name too strange not to be true, while ABC weighs in with Tony Cordesman, a fellow I can only describe as Frankenstein's Correspondent (you keep looking for the cervical bolt).  CBS eventually escalates all the way to General Michael Duggan, the former Air Force chief sacked some weeks back for leaking the air war game plan.</p>
