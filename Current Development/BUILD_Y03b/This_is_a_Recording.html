<h1>This is a Recording</h1>

<p>Urquhart pressed Play and held the little unit up to his ear.  He heard a blip and then the characteristic fuzz of a phone call picked up by a contact mike.</p>

<p><em>"Dr. Agnew?"</p>
</em><p>Silence at first.</p>
<p><em>"Excuse me, have I reached Dr. Dorothea Agnew?"</p>
<p>"Maybe.  What do you want?"</p>
<p>"Dr. Agnew, I represent the Holistic Health Services Consultancy, a national clearinghouse on health-related issues."</p>
<p>"That's nice.  What is it you want?"</p>
<p>"We understand you may have reason to need information about exposure to the Human Immunodeficiency Virus." </p>

</em><p>A click, then another blip as the tape restarts.  Thea's voice.</p>
<p><em>"3:57 a.m., January 10, 1991." </em></p>
