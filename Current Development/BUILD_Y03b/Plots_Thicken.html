<p>The fog thickens alarmingly all around you.  </p>

<p>It's becoming so dense that it's actually gone semi-solid in places — no, all over!  And all of a sudden it's like you're <em>encased</em>  in this stuff, as if you're walking through a tank where somebody's been mixing soapsuds and agar jelly for a new diet desert and all-purpose cleanser.  </p>
