<p>LK:  <em>What exactly are we talking about here?  What specific changes have these alleged radicals talked about?</p>

</em><p>EH:  <em>Well it's hard to know for sure, Larry, since the Committee has repeatedly refused my requests for information.  We do know they've proposed to drop as many as six major authors from the first-year syllabus â€” writers like  St. Thomas Aquinas, John Calvin, and Alexander Pope.  In their place they would substitute works by obscure women and writers from the so-called 'Colonized World.'</p>
