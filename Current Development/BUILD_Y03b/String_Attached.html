<h1>String Attached</h1>

<p><em>The Provost thought it best that the new chair of the Committee come from outside the Humanities, and that he be allied with no political faction.</p>

<p>Of course he did.  And what else did he think?</em></p>

<p>There was another longish pause.  <em>Well, actually he has a candidate in mind.  Someone he thinks both of us ought to be able to agree upon.</em></p>

<p>"Ought to," Thea reflected, as in "must or else no deal."  A stipulation, a string attached.  Well, you didn't get to the top of the pyramid by caving in under threats, did you?  Tate was a better schemer than she thought, and evidently Heidel's three thousand points of light would only take him so far.  </p>

<p>She set out to unwrap the final surprise.  She gave Tate's string a little pull.</p>
