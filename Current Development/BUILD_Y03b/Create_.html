<h1>Create...</h1>

<p>Create, says Tate.  He misquotes to me Barthes: "he used to think of the world as a vast and perpetual conflict of paranoias"...  A little paranoia never hurt anyone, Tate insinuates, nor for that matter a whole lot.  </p>

<p>What makes you think of me as paranoid?  Could be the way everyone spends his time plotting against you.  </p>

<p>Let me tell you about my vision, Tate relates, a vision of the End of History: All the experience of humankind, Tate orates, is a huge cosmic riddle whose answer is — whose answer is Something Out Of Nothing</p>

<p>...and we have only now entered into the age of autonomous and self-modifying simulacra, the moment of convergence between the IS and the COULD BE.  Which is where you come in.</p>
