<h1>Parable</h1>

<p>"Hold on," Macarthur rallied.  "Okay, yeah, the story ends with a death but didn't it occur to you that might be ironic?  Suppose the story's really a parable —"</p>

He was a <a class="textlink"  href="Reading.html">printhead</a> after all — and not even a novelist.  He didn't really care about manyness, matrices, or multiples.  He really wanted things plain and singular.  Something you can <a class="textlink"  href="Wanker.html">get your hands around</a>, see?"  She gave a limp-wristed demonstration.</p>
