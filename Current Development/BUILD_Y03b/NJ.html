<p><em>So where are you guys anyway?  </em> I asked.</p>

<p><em>Camden, New Jersey,</em>  Harley told me.  <em>It's a fine place to be if you're curious about what life must have been like in the Depression.</p>

<p>Camden?</em>  Thea said, <em>Does that mean you're back in school, Veronica? </p>

<p>Sure does.  I'm in the Women's Studies program right now, though I'm thinking I might go for a master's in Social Work...</p>

<p>Way to go, </em> Thea told her.  <em>I'm proud of you, kiddo.</p>

<p>And Harley's been writing,</em>  Veronica added.</p>
