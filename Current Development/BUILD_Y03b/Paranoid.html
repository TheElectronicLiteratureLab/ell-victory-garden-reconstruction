<h1>Paranoid</h1>

<p>Let's face it, if Boris ever wins a Nobel (which he can't since they're not ever likely to give one for Artificial Realty) it'll be thru some kind of bizarre accident.  That amazing work he's supposed to have done back in the eighties, he tells me himself it was a blunder.  He erased a chunk of code once without realizing it and when the remaining bits got back together all kinds of <a class="textlink"  href="Anonymous.html">strange shit happened</a> and the Pentagon creamed its jeans.</p>

<p>Turns out the man isn't brilliant after all.  The man is <a class="textlink"  href="U_Turns.html">simply crazy</a>.  He's come to believe in his own luck, which of course he figures is part of some Cosmic Conspiracy or other.  The world's worst <a class="textlink"  href="Believer.html">true believer</a>, 100% <a class="textlink"  href="_Para_No_.html">paranoid</a>. </p>

<p>The thing is, now that there's no more genius to contend with, I'm finding that I really love the lunatic.  What is this I ask you, some kind of wierd co-dependency thing, Women Who Love Men Who're Right Round the Bend?  Am I ready for Donahue yet?  Or is he contagious maybe â€” am I finally as loony as he is?</p>

<p>Is that a paranoid question?</p>
