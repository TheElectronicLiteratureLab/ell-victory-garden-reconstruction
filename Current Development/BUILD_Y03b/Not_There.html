<p>That wasn't her body she saw in the mirror, that wasn't her pale hair spread over her lover's hips.  It wasn't her smooth thigh trembling in his grasp not her delicate dark-haired mound under his coaxing hand and those weren't her own half-closed eyes she looked into as the woman's head suddenly came up lips drawn tight jaw muscles tense trying to fight it back â€”</p>
