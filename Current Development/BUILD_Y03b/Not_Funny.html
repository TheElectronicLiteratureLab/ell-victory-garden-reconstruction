<h1>Not Funny</h1>

<p>"Well I dunno," the sergeant said.  "How many cars we got here, four?  And did anybody call for backup?"</p>

<p>There was a general round of denials, followed by another long silence.  Harley heard intermittent bursts of police traffic over the car speakers.  One of their dispatchers had patched the audio feed from — of all things, CNN — into his channel.  He heard Bernie Shaw in Baghdad trying to make a joke about surgical bombing.  Like all of Bernie's jokes it sounded like even he didn't think it was funny.</p>

<p>Oh Bernie, Harley thought, have I got a joke for you.</p>

<p>"Well get him in the fucking car and we'll figure it out on the way to County General."</p>

<p>That's right, Harley thought, get me to a fucking hospital.  Then he realized what was probably going to happen en route.</p>
