<h1>Pay Per State</h1>



<p><em>The pay-per society is built around massive amounts of individual consumption.  Yet computer communications are eliminating jobs that provide the income necessary to keep consumption going.  Certainly there are ways of maintaining an economy based on concentrating consumption in a fabulously wealthy elite.  But how will that society <a class="textlink"  href="Anonymous.html">control</a> the millions who are denied?</em></p>
