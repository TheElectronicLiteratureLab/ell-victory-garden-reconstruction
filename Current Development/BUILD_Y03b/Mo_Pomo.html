<p>"Last night something really frightening happened," Harley related.  "Last night the dream seemed longer and more exhaustive than ever, I seemed to be examining my own body down to the last follicle and nose hair."</p>

<p>"I'd say you've spent a bit too much time <a class="textlink"  href="Zaun.html">on camera</a>," Urquhart speculated.</p>

<p>"Yeah, could be.  Only listen to this.  The more I saw of my body, the more convinced I became that it wasn't really mine."</p>
