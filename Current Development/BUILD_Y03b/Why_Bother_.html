<h1>Why Bother?</h1>
<em>
<p>Well gee, Erich, what can I say?  If you're in such a strong position why even bother offering me a deal?  Why not just have Tate appoint you to chair the Committee?</em></p>

<p>Silence on the line.</p>

<p>Okay, Thea decided, this is still a contest.  Whatever his politics, institutional or otherwise, Tate had no affection for Erich Heidel.  It was well known.  He must have cut his own deal with Heidel and his pressure group.</p>

<p>But what would the terms of this deal have been?</p>
