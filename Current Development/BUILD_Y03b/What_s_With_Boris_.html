<h1>What's With Boris?</h1>

<p>"Okay we'll cut the crap," Tate considerately turning the other cheek while he shucked out of the codpiece, rolled down those hose, and slipped into a pair of faded bermudas.  He seemed to be having trouble with the zipper.  "What's up with Urquhart anyway?"</p>

<p>Resisting the temptation to peep at her Provost's hindparts, Thea stared over at Miles Macarthur, who shrugged his shoulderpads and turned to Harley, who passed the inquisitory gaze right over to you, Veronica.  For her part, Veronica was checking out the old guy's ass, wondering how anyone could ever find white men attractive, knowing they'd eventually end up like this.</p>

<p>"Jesus," Tate observed, "you're  about as forthcoming as a bunch of graduate students.  And you need not consider that a compliment, Miss Runbird.  Can someone please tell me, I don't care how speculatively, where this problem of Urquhart's originates?  Is it political?  Organic?  Intellectual?  Erotic?  Is the fault in his stars, for Chrissake?"</p>
