<h1>Foursome</h1>

<p><em>Chill, babe.  It was more like we found him than him finding us.  Actually we saw him play in a teen club in Boston.  Not much of a songwriter but he's a great kid â€” real mellow.  He must take after his dad...</p>

<p>You're still full of bullshit, Harley</em> , I observed.</p>

<p><em>Anyway, we quite enjoyed the time he spent with us.</p>

<p>Does this 'we' still mean you and Veronica? </em>  Thea asked.</p>

<p>A woman's voice came on, young-sounding, musical, with an accent from all over.  Veronica Runbird, I supposed.  <em>Hey, Thea.  How's life in the golden west? </p>

<p>Not so bad, kiddo.</em>  Thea sounded friendly but her voice had lost some warmth.</p>
