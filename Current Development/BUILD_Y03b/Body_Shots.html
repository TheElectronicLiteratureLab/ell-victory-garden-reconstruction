<h1>Body Shots</h1>

<p>Veronica was out in the kitchen trying to explain her position on the mideast crisis to a representative of the Maoist Literary Group.  Harley Morgan was on the porch re-learning the jerk from a bald woman in pink chifonne.  <a class="textlink"  href="Leroy.html">Leroy Sieger</a> was lying low, trying to pass himself off as eighteen and hoping his mom wouldn't find out.  Jude Busch was in the living room showing Thea Agnew all about body shots.</p>
