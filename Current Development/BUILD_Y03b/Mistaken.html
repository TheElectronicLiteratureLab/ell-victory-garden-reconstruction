<p>Tate staggers toward you, hauling his metal clothing along with him.  He reaches out and lifts up your mask.  — Oh, it's you, he observes.  He sounds disappointed.</p>

<p>— You were expecting maybe Reed Richards?</p>

<p>Tate drops his visor back into place and gives one of the artists an experimental thrashing.  — No, he says, pausing on the upswing, actually I thought you might be...</p>

<p>— Eh?</p>

<p>— Our mysterious keynote speaker.</p>

<p>— Who?</p>

<p>— Nevermind.</p>
