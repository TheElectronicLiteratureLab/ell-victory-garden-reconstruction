<p>Jude flicked off the flashlight and handed the letter back to Amanda, who stashed it inside her suit.  This time she kept the zipper tight.  </p>

<p>"It's bullshit in the letter, right?  I mean, about Thea Agnew resigning."</p>

<p>Jude nodded.  "Most likely.  Veronica says Thea wants to tough it out and make it a real fight if she has to.  This smells like a power play of some kind.  If I had to guess, I'd say that somebody's trying to <a class="textlink"  href="Caller.html">run a game</a> on her."</p>

<p>Amanda pushed off from the railing and headed down the stairs.  "Oh goody.  I really like games."</p>
