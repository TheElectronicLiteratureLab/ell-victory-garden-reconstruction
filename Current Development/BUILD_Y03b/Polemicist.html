<h1>Polemicist</h1>

<p>At this point the air was cleft by a mighty eruption — "YOOAAUUURRFthpt, es-KEWS me, ladies" — heralding the arrival of 
<a class="textlink"  href="Critics.html">Billy Van</a> Saxgutter, horn arranger and main polemicist for the cowboy-funk group Boogie/Dogey.</p>

<p>"Bean dip," Veronica repeated.  "Where's that bean dip."</p>

<p>Billy Van, whose notoriety in the alternative press owed to his uncanny resemblance to the young LBJ, cranked back his Stetson and scratched along his imaginary gall bladder scar.  "Beg pard'n, stranger," he said to Myron Something, "but did Ah heer yew say'n sumpin maht be constrew'd as DIS-loil t'ahr brave men 'n' wimmen in the Gulf?"</p>

<p>Myron was, frankly, agoggle.  "Oh wow," he marveled.  "Oh fucking <em>wow</em>.  The god of the fascists, live and in person."  He wanted to reach out and touch the squinting apparition, but was afraid it might bite.</p>
