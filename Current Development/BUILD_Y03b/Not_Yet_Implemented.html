<h1>Not Yet Implemented</h1>

<p><em>Waitaminute</em> THAT <em>wasn't so horrible</em>.</p>

<p>Sorry, looks like you're a tougher mark than I gave you credit.  Force me to confess and I'll tell you all about a basic narrative problem, representing the unpresentable, seems to be a lot of it going around these days, damn <a class="textlink"  href="Mo_Pomo.html">postmodernism</a> to whatever.  </p>

<p>Can't seem to think of the right visual effect to pull this one off, you see.  Fade to nothing.  Doesn't seem to be implemented.</p>

<p>Where's the blankness can represent the Ultimate Nobody Home?  Needs further research.  Take a walk out that window, tell me what you see...</p>
