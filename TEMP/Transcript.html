</em><p>LK: <em> Professor Heidel, in the last few months there's been a lot in the media about changes in the Western Culture requirement for undergraduates at the University of Tara.  I think it's safe to say that this is no longer a local matter but an issue that has gained national attention.  Could you please tell us briefly, in your opinion, what all the fuss is about.</p>

</em><p>EH:<em>  I'd be glad to, Larry.  When you get through all the <a class="textlink"  href="Emily_to_Thea.html">rhetoric</a>, in which I might add Professor Agnew is a specialist, what you see is an attempt by a handful of tenured radicals to subvert humanistic education as we have known it at the U. of T.  Basically they're trying to uproot two thousand years of history and culture and replace it with their own narrow, <a class="textlink"  href="Talking_Politics.html">highly politicized ideas.</a></p>
