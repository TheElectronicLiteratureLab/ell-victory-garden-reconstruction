<p><em>Once there was a great monastery deep in a European forest.  This monastery was once  a center of faith, learning, and spirituality.  But as the world moved further from God, the monastery fell on hard times.  All its branch houses  were seized by the State and in the mother house only four monks remained, the old Abbot and three brothers, all over seventy.</p>

<p>It happened that this monastery lay in a forest not far from a little hut that a rabbi used as a hermitage.  From years of fasting and prayer the monks had developed a kind of second sight, so that they knew when the rabbi came to his hut.   </p>

<p>They would pause in their work or observances and say to each other, "The rabbi is in the woods again."</p>
