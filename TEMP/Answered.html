<p>"Boris," Tate said as gently as he could, "I really don't know what you're talking about."</p>

<p>"You have the answer," U replied.  "Tate.  The answer to everything."</p>

<p>Tate walked over to him, put his hands on the poor fellow's shoulders, tried to calm him down.  "Hey, now, Boris.  I'm afraid that makes no sense at all."</p>

<p>U looked him in the eye, face to face.  A spark of recognition settled on him, a moment of recovery.</p>

<p>"No," he said.  "It doesn't make sense."</p>

<p>Urquhart let go of the book.  It fell heavily onto the toes of Tate's left foot.</p>

<p>"Ow."</p>
