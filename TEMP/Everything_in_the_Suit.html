<p>"I had this dream," Dexter said as they reclosed his seals.  "Actually a kind of fantasy."</p>

<p>"How nice for you," Emily said.  "I don't want to hear about it."</p>

<p>"I imagine finding some real nice <a class="textlink"  href="Foxy.html">foxy</a> chick, present company excepted of course, who actually wants to <a class="textlink"  href="Lighten_Up.html"><em>make love in the suit</em></a>. "</p>

<p>"Oh mercy, Dexter's got a rubber kink," the Whizzer lamented.</p>
