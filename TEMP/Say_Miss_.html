<h1>Say, Miss...</h1>

<p>"Aw shit," Vance objected, extricating himself from a pile of bodies under the dashboard.  "I just <em>hate</em>  asking directions.  You do it."</p>

<p>Billy Van called him six kinds of varmint but jammed the bus back into gear, swung around and blasted back eastward in the westbound lane of Lago Vista.  He crunched to a halt opposite the pedestrian, leaned out and raised his hatbrim.</p>

<p>"Evenin' miss."</p>

<p>Leroy Sieger stared at this apppearance in the night, thinking oh shit next time only <em>one</em>  mushroom.  He was looking at a 1971 VW microbus standing wrongway round in the middle of the road.  It was painted in a psychedelic style that owed more to Matt Groening than R. Crumb.  Its driver was this sinister-looking guy in a string tie and hornrimmed glasses whose face reminded him of <a class="textlink"  href="Maddening.html">someone he'd seen on the tube</a>.  The fellow was squinting at Leroy in plain vexation.</p>
