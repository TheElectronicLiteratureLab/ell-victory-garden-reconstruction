<h1>East</h1>

<p>The images on the screens brightened and stabilized.</p>

<p>The display at the eastern end of the room carried live video from Urquhart's office down the hall.  A large man wearing a bowling shirt and headphones was stretched out on a truly ugly Italian couch.  His sleeping cap was wired for EEG.</p>

<p>"My colleague," Urquhart explained,  "Dr. Miles Macarthur of the Institute for Hypermedia Operations and Procedures in Las Vegas.  Dr. Macarthur will be our human interactor this evening."</p>

<p>Macarthur flashed a V-sign at the camera, yawned and pulled on a  pair of red felt sleepshades.  </p>

<p>"Nighty night."</p>
