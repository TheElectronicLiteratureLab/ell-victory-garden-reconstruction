<h1>Ringing Tone</h1>

<p>The telephone was ringing.</p>

<p>Veronica felt the sound reach under the ribs, tightening a knot of tension there.  Given what had already gone down here and abroad, she shared Thea's foreboding.  She closed her eyes and sat still, thinking of <a class="textlink"  href="Blackout.html">another phone call</a>, perhaps not so far in her future, that she might not want to answer.</p>

<p>The phone rang.  There was a little red lamp on the instrument that pulsed in time to the ringing tone.  It bathed the kitchen in strobe light, making inert surfaces seem to dance. </p>

<p>Leroy got up and stood by the telephone, wondering what next, where do we go from here?  He reached for the handset but hesitated.</p>

<p>The phone rang.</p>
