<h1>What He Could See</h1>

<p>What Madden could see wasn't much â€” a point of light, not very bright really, against a black field.  There may have been some shadowy mass around the bright point, or it might just have been Madden's blurred vision.  His eyes weren't what they'd once been.</p>

<p>"This thing is in the plane of the ecliptic?" Madden surmised.</p>

<p>"That's right.  Moving on a parabolic trajectory that will carry it  around, or more likely into, the sun."</p>

<p>"Sounds like a comet to me.  Maybe a rare one."</p>

<p>"It could be.  Though from the way it looks, it's more likely an asteroid."</p>
