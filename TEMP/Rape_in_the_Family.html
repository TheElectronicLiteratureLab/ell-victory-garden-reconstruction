<h1>Rape in the Family</h1>


<p>Mr. Bush tells us a story about the bad man Sad'm Hasane, who raped his neighbor and was thrown out of the family of nations.</p>

<p>Bad seed, excitable boy.  A story we can understand.  Take a page from the Great Communicator for this one.</p>

<p>But if Sad'm says he's sorry, and if he acknowledges the New World Order, we'll let him back into the family.</p>
