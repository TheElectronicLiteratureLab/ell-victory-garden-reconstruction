<h1>Time and Violence</h1>

<p>Urquhart saw the truck for perhaps three seconds, long enough to think about impact and pain.  Not long enough to react.  Staring at the yellow light, checking for cops in the rearview, Jaime Col√≥n did not see the onrushing Porsche at all.</p>

<p>What happened was all very fast.  Bodies in space.  Intersecting trajectories.  It played out so quickly that Madden almost couldn't say what he saw.  </p>

<p><a class="textlink"  href="War_Zones.html">Time and violence</a>.  Inevitable outcomes.  The two tracks closing, too close to call.  </p>

<p><em>The future already exists</em>.</p><em></p>

</em><p>But which one?</p>
