<h1>Some Scene</h1>

<p>They sat in silence for two or three minutes, Urquhart continuing to stare and think.  Jude had been through this drill before and was not deterred.  She sat chin-in-hand, studying the back of his head, sending out waves of determination.  Finally Urquhart changed tactics, offering her a cheroot if she wanted.  "They're in the drawer.  And you might light one for me while you're at it."  Aha, the old I'm-a-sexist-pig ploy.  But Jude was wise to this, too.  </p>

<p>She found the cigars in the desk drawer under a heap of circuit cards and what looked like an empty pistol clip.  Academics, you never could tell.  She trimmed the cigars, got them started and passed one to Urquhart, who took it without turning around.  </p>

<p>"That was some scene last Friday at <a class="textlink"  href="Veronica_s_Party.html">Veronica Runbird's party</a>,"  Jude remarked.</p>
