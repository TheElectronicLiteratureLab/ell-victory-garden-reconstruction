<h1>Courteous</h1>

<p><em>I promise you, it's only out of courtesy that I'm calling tonight. </p>
</em>
<p><em>How kind of you.</em></p>

<p>Courteous, kind, obedient, cheeful.  Heidel the Eagle Scout, though she doubted he'd had that much initiative.  Courtesy: give a lady her due, show some respect there's a laugh.  Heidel you're a patronizing two-faced sexist bastard on top of everything else.  Bend over and put your courtesy back where it belongs.</p>

<p>But it came to her chillingly that Heidel seemed unusually magnanimous and full of himself â€” which meant that he felt ready to deal some really high-handed blow.</p>

<p>What was coming?</p>
