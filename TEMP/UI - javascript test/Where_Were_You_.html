<h1>Where Were You?</h1>

<p>Where were <a class="textlink"  href="Timely.html">you</a> when the news came?  </p>

<p>You might have been among the half million shipped out to Armageddon, in which case it was no news to you.</p>

<p>Or perhaps like the rest of us you got caught looking.  Maybe it reached you on the air, down from the satellite, pulsing through the cable, all those <a class="textlink"  href="Thea_s_War.html">male faces</a> taut with excitement, with concern, with the rush of the big story.  Did it catch you at your evening meal, a blast from decades past?</p>

<p>How did it make you feel â€” scared, depressed, elated, unreal?  When <a class="textlink"  href="Mr_Postman_Look_See.html">History</a> unfolded around you, did you see it as a poison flower (fucked, like the man say, down to its eternal root), or did it seem to you a fantastic <a class="textlink"  href="7-3-91.html">firework</a>, some gorgeous <a class="textlink"  href="Noted_in_Passing.html">portent of the skies</a>?</p>
