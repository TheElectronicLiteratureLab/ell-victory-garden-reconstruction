<h1>Unexpected</h1>

<p>Jude got up from the bed and stepped out of her dress and panties, kneeling to help Victor off with his jeans.  He started to peel down his underwear but she stopped him, wanting to do that herself.  His breath caught when she bared his cock, a big teardrop of desire shining at the tip.  She took a step back and crossed her arms, deciding all of a sudden to tease. </p>

<p>Jude watched him watching her, his penis thick and stirring.  He looked at her in anticipation.  If she was serious about taking him back to the past, she'd know what came next.</p>

<p>And in fact Jude knew exactly what he wanted.  It was easy enough â€” she only had to think what the other woman would have thought, where she found her pleasures, how she would have made love to this man.  Jude knew what he wanted.  She felt herself go warm at the thought.  But she had her own agenda. </p>
