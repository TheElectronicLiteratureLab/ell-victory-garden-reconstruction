<h1>Morning</h1>

<p>Thea comes to me this morning full of demands and schemes, all that funk and lethargy finally behind her.  We need to rethink the chapter on postmodern politics.  Have I read <a class="textlink"  href="Cyborg_Politics.html">Haraway</a> on situated knowledge yet?  Why won't her Macintosh boot from the external hard drive?  Do these shorts show too much derriére, and do I really care?</p>

<p>I think it means something, this sudden abundance of energy.  I think it means she's beginning to accommodate herself, to accept her place in the sun.  Waking up Californian — sooner or later it happens to all of us.</p>

<p>She sits on my deck wearing some of Alastair's old shades, reading last week's <em>Chronicle</em>  and doing a sort of play-by-play.  I've never met anyone for whom academic culture seemed so much like <a class="textlink"  href="Body_Shots.html">professional wrestling</a>.</p>

<p>My day starts well <a class="textlink"  href="At_Play.html">when she comes</a>.</p>
