<p>Bob's Friend and Bob's Other Friend raise their masks solemnly, regarding you with a kind of temporary awe.  They give you the look you'd give any geek who showed up with a 2,000 candlepower halo around his head claiming to be the alleged Messiah, right, you'd treat him with a sort of provisional reverence at least until you found where he'd stashed the projection gear.</p>

<p>— Haven't I seen you on Letterman?  Bob's Friend asks.  TRANS: <em>AREN'T YOU THE MAN? </em></p>

<p>— Shit, no, you reply.  TRANS: <em>WELL MAYBE...  WHAT'S IT TO YOU? </p>

</em><p>The Komitehmen turn to each other, slide their masks back down and bang foreheads.  <em>— Golly gee, Chauncey, I think we got us a live one!</em></p>
