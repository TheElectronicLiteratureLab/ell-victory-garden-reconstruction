<h1>Something Wild</h1>

<p>
Harley winced.  "I know exactly what Cap'n T. or Bernie or even 
<a class="textlink"  href="Not_Now.html">Fitzmaurice</a> 
would say about her.  Something like, 'Well Harley, guess 
<a class="textlink"  href="The_Seventies.html">the sixties</a> aren't over after all, go for it, dude.'"
</p><p>
"And I thought academics were cynical."
</p><p>
He reached out and took Urquhart by the forearm, a rare thing for a reticent guy like Harley.  "It's not like that."
</p><p>
"Okay, it's not."
</p><p>
"She's not just my walk on the wild side.  I love her."
