<h1>Pragmatics</h1>

<p>"The problem with all this," Tate mused, "is that I don't believe in coincidence."</p>

<p>Heidel shrugged, standing in the darkness.  What Tate might or might not believe mattered little to him.  Tate was after all a pragmatist: what mattered above all was what he would choose to do.</p>

<p>"I don't care how the war came about," Heidel called up to him.  "It's here now.  It defines the conditions with which we have to work."</p>

<p>"What?" Tate said, clearly distracted.</p>

<p>"The war," Heidel repeated, beginning to grow peevish.</p>

<p>"Oh yes," said Tate.  "There's the war, yes."</p>
