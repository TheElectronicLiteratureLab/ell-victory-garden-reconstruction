<h1>No Genius</h1>
<tt>
<p><a class="textlink"  href="Facial_Hair.html">Boris</a>.  He improves with distance I guess.  I really do miss him these days &amp; that's not just me hormoaning.  How long have we been together anyway â€” must be nearly three years.  You should know, you were the one introduced us (<a class="textlink"  href="Poor_Correspondent.html"><u>its all your fault</u></a>).  </p>

<p>At first I thought he was a genius, you know, or OK maybe you don't know and it sounds silly.  So I'm silly.  I admit it, I thought he was fucking brilliant (not to mention <a class="textlink"  href="A_True_Story.html">a brilliant fuck</a>).  I was actually scared to talk to him.</p>

<p>Anyway after a hundred years or so it finally dawned on me that <a class="textlink"  href="Computer_Reads_Dreams_.html">this wasn't genius</a> after all.  Was it the day I discovered he never balanced his checkbook, just opened a new bank account when it got too screwed up?  Or the time we got lost going up to Santa Fe and after half a day driving in circles I see what map he's reading and it's South Dakota.</p>
