<h1>Why Worry?</h1>

<p>"Don't piss your pants about it," the Whizzer admonished.  "Nobody said this was a vacation trip.  Besides, the jets and rockets aren't the worst part.  What you really want to look out for is what they used to call that 'fifth column.'  Terrorists and saboteurs.  Some kid in a Mercedes with ten kilos of TNT in the back seat.  Or the Walkman with the Semtex headphones, that's a neat trick, cracks your skull like a raw egg.  Wouldn't want to come across one of those jobs stuck in the old bulk sorter, would you Dex."</p>

<p>"Well gee Mister Wizard, thanks so much for that info."  Dexter slapped his buddy upside the hood.  "Shit, I can't take this no more."  Seeing the Sarge looking the other way, Dexter peeled back his headgear and sniffed.  "Smells like a mylar fart in here."</p>

<p>"Chill, Dexter," Sergeant Yvonne advised.  "And get that bag back on your head real quick if you see the Lieutenant coming."</p>

<p>Dexter cracked a smile.  "She don't like my face."</p>
