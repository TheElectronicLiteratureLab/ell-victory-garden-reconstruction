<p>Madden sat down in the viewer's chair and put his head to the eyepiece.  There was a considerable scrunch involved because he had a good five inches on Tate.  At first he couldn't see much of anything.  Tate got up apologetically and made some fine adjustments.</p>

<p>"There may be billions of cometary bodies out in the Oort cloud," Tate told him, "yet close approaches to the earth are rare.  This is because most comets come in on angles quite oblique to the ecliptic, the plane in which the planetary orbits lie."</p>

<p>Madden finally got the eyepiece figured out, drawing on his long experience with binoculars and other peeping devices.  He saw what he could see.</p>

<p>"It is highly unlikely that a comet or other fast moving object would approach in the plane of the ecliptic," Tate continued.  "But look there."</p>
