<h1>Mistaken Identity</h1>

<p>Seems that after one too many coach flights into Pittsburgh, old Gerry decided to cash in some of his <a class="textlink"  href="13-F.html">perpetual flyer</a> miles for a boost into First.  So the G-man is sitting there at 25,000 feet sipping his Chablis when one of the flighties says, "Excuse me, Mr. Madden, the gentleman in 4-C asks if you wouldn't mind an autograph."  Madden turns around, sees this dude in a suit costs more than he owes on his mortgage.  Dude looks familiar.  Madden goes over and asks who he should make out the autograph to.  The dude says, "Best Regards to Ivan Figueroa and all my fans in Newport."</p>

<p>Madden makes out the autograph, Ivan takes it from him and gets a little puzzled.  "What's this, ain't your real name John, and what's these three letters after your name, F-B... <em>ay, caramba</em>.<em>.</em>"</p>

<p>Turns out Ivan is middle management from Medell√≠n wanted on warrants local and Federal.  Doink!    </p>

<p>Madden got commended.</p>
