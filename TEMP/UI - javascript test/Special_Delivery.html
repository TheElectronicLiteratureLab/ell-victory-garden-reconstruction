<p>The angel is flying straight into the sun, which seems to you not so much a blinding radiance or a fiery furnace or a celestial presence but a horrible <a class="textlink"  href="Into_the_Wreck.html">clean well lighted place</a>. </p>

<p>You are convinced that you will find it filled with stoic expatriates of your grandfather's generation who will tell endless tales of moose hunting and start pathetic fistfights and force you to buy them drinks <a class="textlink"  href="The_Red_King.html">for all eternity</a>.</p>
