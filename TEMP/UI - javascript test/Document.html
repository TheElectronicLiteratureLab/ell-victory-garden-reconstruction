<p>Jude got out the flashlight, hunkered down below the wall and scanned the paper.</p>

<p><em>Dear Mrs. Stellenbosch,</p>

<p>Thank you for your letter about the proposed tentative revisions in the Western Civilization curriculum at the University.  As you know I am always sensitive to the concerns of alumni, especially when they have been such strong supporters of our academic and athletic programs.</p>

<p>I share your reservations about the rejection of western culture and traditional values in the proposed curriculum revisions.  Thank you for letting me know your concerns.  I am pleased to be able to tell you that the Chair of the Revised Curriculum Committee has agreed to give up that position to a person whose views are more representative of the American mainstream.  A formal announcement will be made soon...</em></p>
