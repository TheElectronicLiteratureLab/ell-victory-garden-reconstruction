<h1>Passenger</h1>

<p>"Boris?"  Harley blinked hard.</p>

<p>"Get in, get in."</p>

<p>He considered.  Try a soft approach, maybe.  "Okay Boris, sure.  I'd be happy to join you, let's go find a party, anything you say.  But why don't you let me drive?"</p>

<p>Urquhart revved the engine and made to roll up his window.</p>

<p>"Okay, for shit's sake."  Harley dashed around to the passenger side, hauled the door open and flung himself in.  "Boris, be cool for Chrissake.  I mean, can we talk about this?"</p>

<p>Urquhart released his left foot convulsively and Harley's skull popped back against the headrest.  "Nice car," he remarked.</p>
