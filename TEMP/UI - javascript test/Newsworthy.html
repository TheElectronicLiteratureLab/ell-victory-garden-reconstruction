<h1>Newsworthy</h1>

<p>Tate reached into his doublet and produced a copy of last week's alternative paper, the Tara <em>Happening</em>,  featuring all over its front page a grainy photo of the town's latest cultural attraction, Uqbari the Pissing Prophet.  "Look at it this way," Harley pointed out, "if they'd shot from any other angle, the wire services would have snatched it right up."</p>

<p>Tate reached back into his doublet and came out with a UPI photofax.  "Skillful airbrushing," he noted.  Macarthur scrutinized the print, turning it first left, then right, then upside down.  "Digitally enhanced," he added.</p>
