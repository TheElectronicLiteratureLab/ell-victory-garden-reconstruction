<h1>Postindustrial</h1>

<p><em>"Fifth of November.  Light dissolves in the sky like the cry of a fishmonger who has come to the wrong street.</em>   The man was very lyrical.  Let's see, this next part is mainly about his bowels, then there's this about his mother...  Oh but here it is:  <em>In regard to the subject of economic redevelopment.  It is to be remembered, even in the face of the total devastation we now experience, that the rebuilding of factories and shipyards represents only the first stage in the coming of a new world order.  If our nation would prosper in the coming decades we must expand our horizons.  We must consider our destiny in ways that transcend material production." </em></p>

<p>"Well," U noted, "this all has a familiar ring to it."</p>

<p>"Wait, the best is yet to come."</p>
