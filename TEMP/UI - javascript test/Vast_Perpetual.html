<h1>Vast & Perpetual</h1>

<p>Create, says Tate.  He misquotes to me Barthes: "he used to think of the world as a vast and perpetual conflict of paranoias" (yeah, but he was wrong, all the time it was this great big <a class="textlink"  href="No_Obstructions.html"><em>laundry truck</a> </em>...)  A little paranoia never hurt anyone, Tate insinuates, nor for that matter a whole lot.  What makes you think of me as paranoid?  Could be the way everyone spends his time plotting against you.  If they are, I explain, it's because you put them up to it.  Let me tell you about my vision, Tate relates, a vision of the End of History.  Soon to be a major motion fixture, sez I, with Ronald Reagan as Charlton Heston and <a class="textlink"  href="God_s_Comic.html">NBC as God</a>.  All the experience of humankind, Tate orates, is a huge cosmic riddle whose answer is —  Hurry up please it's — Don't interrupt: whose answer is Something Out Of Nothing, or the becomingness of being.  Gosh, I wouldn't have guessed in a billion years.  Nor is this vast achievement complete, Tate estimates, for we have only now entered into the age of autonomous and self-modifying simulacra, the moment of convergence between the IS and the COULD BE.  Which is where you come in.  ME? sez I.  That's right, Tate stipulates, U must engineer a System — or be enraged by another man's.  <a class="textlink"  href="A_Little_Paranoia.html">Hang on</a>, I protest, I got this terrible Swarming Sensation...</p>
