<h1>Tender</h1>

<p>"You've got to have it tender."  Yvonne pursed her lips and thought about it.  "Waking up in the morning with your arms around your man, coming home to find him there.  Being with somebody who don't spend all his time drooling over whore pictures and trying to get his hands down your pants.  Somebody a whole lot different from these soldier boys.  What these horny suckers want from you they can usually get inside of sixty seconds."  She turned to Emily for confirmation.  "Look at this Runbird, look at her blushing!  But you know how it is, girl, they get it in there for a minute or two then it's O-O-Omygod and they let their fat ass fall asleep on top of you.  That's all you get outa them â€” <a class="textlink"  href="Have_a_Seat.html">bang-bang, shoot-shoot</a>."</p>

<p>"Yeah," said Emily, "sometimes I think you're lucky if that's all they want."  She passed the bottle back.</p>

<p>"Whatever," Yvonne shrugged.</p>
