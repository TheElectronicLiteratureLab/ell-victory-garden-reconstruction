<h1>Cybercrimes</h1>

<p>"Naw, Snyder, just my car keys and beeper."  Their drinks showed up and they lifted their glasses to the usual, A Return To Sanity.  One of these days, maybe.</p>

<p>"So Gerry, what's new in your shop?"</p>

<p>Madden scratched his jaw.  "Nothing to speak of.  Aggravation.  S.O.S."</p>

<p>"I heard you got stuck with some of that new Task Force hoo-ha — what's that called? — 'cybercrime?' — Jeez, it sounds like a comic book."</p>

<p>Madden winced.  "Comic books" had been a sore subject in the Bureau since the end of the Hoover days.  "Yeah.  Mickey Mouse in the 21st Century.  Somebody's been <a class="textlink"  href="High_Road.html">traipsing</a> through a secure D-o-D network, and the folks in charge think it's serious.  Probably some twelve-year-old doesn't even know what he's into.  Shit, Snyder, they ought to put you on the case."</p>
