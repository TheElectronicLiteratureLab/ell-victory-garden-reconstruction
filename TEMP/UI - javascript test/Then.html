<h1>Then</h1>

<p>It's 3:17 a.m. and she's awake again.  I can hear her down in the living room leafing through a magazine.  I go down and lie on the couch with her, my head in her lap.  "Was it the same dream?"  This time it's she who strokes my head.  </p>

<p>She nods.  I notice fresh tear trails along her cheekbones.</p>

<p>"Did you love her?" I ask.  I'm looking into her face but she won't meet my eyes.</p>

<p>"Lots of people <a class="textlink"  href="The_Love_You_Take.html">loved her</a>," she says.  "<a class="textlink"  href="All_You_Need.html">They still do</a>."</p>

<p>I put my cheek against her thigh, stroking the underside of her breast.  "More to the point, did she love you?"  But as soon as I say it I wish I hadn't, because it makes her cry.</p>
