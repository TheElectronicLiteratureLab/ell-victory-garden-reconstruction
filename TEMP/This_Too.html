<p>Boris holds up his fingers V and says: This is the Problem.</p>

<p>But you don't get it, do you.  Boris lifts up his mask and underneath he's wearing a face you've never seen before though you suspect it may belong to the invisible Man.</p>

<p>Jude is holding up Boris's fingers too, and she adds: The Problem is that This Isn't The Answer.</p>

<p>— Nuh-uh, you assent, I don't think this is the answer to anything.</p>

<p>Wearing his invisible face Boris begins to weep invisible tears and in a flash of empathy you feel inside yourself that he is mourning for his own failure, your failure, and the failure of everyone here to find any kind of answer.</p>

<p>— Aw cheer up, Jude offers.  This two shall pass.</p>
