<p>"Folks bathe together 'round these parts."</p>
<p>"Don't be a stranger."  </p>
<p>"Come on guy, get wet!"</p><em></p>

<p>So what were you going to do, let all these nice people down?  Macarthur spread his arms and offered himself to nature.  He hit the water more or less broadside, making a very big splash.  A general cheer went up from the crowd as Miles came up blowing and snorting.  The water did indeed feel wonderful.  It even tasted good.</p>

<p>"What do you think?" Thea asked.</p>

<p>"It's amazing," Miles testified.</p>

<p>"That's nice," a woman in a black tank suit called over, "enjoy it while you can."</p>
