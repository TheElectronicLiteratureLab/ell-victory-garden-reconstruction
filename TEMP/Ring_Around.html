<h1>Ring Around</h1>

<p>U is once again still always running through that dark field, slipping scrambling through his own footprints on the dry ground.  He knows Madden is behind him somewhere but he doesn't dare look.  You've had this dream before, you know.</p>

<p>U crosses the parking lot stumbles against the door of the observatory.  His ribs hut like hell and his mouth is full of clotted blood; his clothes are still a mess.  This doesn't matter, since U has practically no awareness of his physical state.  He is aware only of the idea that has seized him, the necessity, the overwhelming need.</p>

<p><em>The answer to everything.</em>  Everything for nothing now.</p>
<em>
</em><p>The double doors are locked but there's a pushbutton, which he presses.  Strange music comes from inside: sounds like Laurie Anderson scatting the third movement of Rimski-Korsakov's <em>Scheherezade</em>.  A light is coming toward him, swinging up and down with its bearer's step.  Tate opens the door, shining his light in his visitor's eyes.</p>
