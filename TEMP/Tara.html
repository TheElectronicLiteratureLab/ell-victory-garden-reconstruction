<h1>Tara</h1>

<p>The city of Tara, deep in the heart of the Commonwealth of Tara, contains 450,000 souls, a major research university, the Commonwealth Congress, many excellent <a class="textlink"  href="John_Law.html">taverns, caf√©s, and night spots</a>, several million bats, and statues of Elvis Presley and Jefferson Davis.</p>

<p>The Davis statue dominates a long plaza near the gates of the University, where it has become something of an embarrassment.  Recently the Trustees commissioned a statue of the Reverend <a class="textlink"  href="Capitol.html">Martin Luther King, Jr.</a>, which they erected at the other end of the plaza.  The statue was to be dedicated on the 15th of January, but <a class="textlink"  href="Where_Were_You_.html">events in the Gulf</a> forced a postponement. </p>

<p>Last time I looked, the cloths were still on.</p>
