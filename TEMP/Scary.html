<h1>Scary</h1>

<p>"Did I hurt you?" he asked, concerned.</p>

<p>"No."  She touched his arm reassuringly.  "No.  But it scares me the way I am with you, Victor.  It scares me half to death."</p>

<p>He stroked her hair, nuzzled her cheek.  "I don't understand what you're saying.  What do you mean?  What's so scary?"</p>

<p>"I can't explain.  It's just what I feel.  I'm scared."</p>

<p>"Do you mean <a class="textlink"  href="Five_Hundred.html">the sex</a>?  Are you still â€”"</p>

<p>She shook her head vigorously.  "Yes.  No, not exactly.  There's something scary about it.  And no, it's not just the sex either.  There are other things."</p>
