<h1>Otherness</h1>
<tt>
<p>Being a woman is supposed to mean being an Other, little sister.  Vive la <a class="textlink"  href="Firm.html">difference</a>, just like the sexist bastards say.  I admit I'm pretty hard-assed about it, but to me that Otherness isn't just negative â€” you can't define a woman as a not-man.  Otherness is a positive demand, a business to be in, a business of being.  Being a woman means going the other way, not joining their team, not wearing their uniform.  It means staying out of their games.  It means you have to find your own way.</p>

<p>I know what you've written, I know you see this differently.  Vive la difference, right.  The whole postmodern thing makes sense to you, while you know that I think it's a lot of horseshit.  Like that crazy man you sleep with, you think <u>everything's</u> a game.  One big game and all of us players.</p>

<p>You think you can change the game from the inside, don't you, you and Boris with all your talk about Chaos.  You think that little twists and wrinkles can throw throw off their big System. Do you still think that now?  Now that you're on the team?</p>
