<h1>Worlds Collide</h1>

<p>It was a fine idea this two-world doctrine, but the seal would not hold.  </p>

<p>Back in that other world of <a class="textlink"  href="Suit_Time.html">time and violence</a> the frayed voices were spilling from the media, filling the rooms, leaking through flimsy sunbelt insulation into outer darkness.  He could try to be Outside but it wasn't happening.  <a class="textlink"  href="Visitor.html">The voices</a> would find him here.  </p>

<p>Things didn't sound promising back in the other world.  Though <a class="textlink"  href="Dream.html">Urquhart could not make out a single word</a>, the tones of voice told him everything.  The <a class="textlink"  href="Halftones.html">newshounds</a> had their blood up.  <a class="textlink"  href="Gas_Masks.html">Something nasty</a> was in the offing.</p>

<p>He thought about <a class="textlink"  href="Facial_Hair.html">Emily</a> and suddenly his head felt much too full.</p>
