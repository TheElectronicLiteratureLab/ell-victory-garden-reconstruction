<h1>Bird Fiver-Two</h1>

<p>Of course, some spirits of this world cruise above the <a class="textlink"  href="Name_That_Fear.html">cycles of oblivion and return</a>...</p>

<p><em>"Originally designed to fly 5,000 hours before structural fatigue, most B-52's are expected to achieve at least 15,000 hours.  It is estimated that the planes could be used in active duty until 2035, eighty years after the first delivery."</em>   (New York Times )</p>

<p>Takes you back, don't it, straight to that nasty musical joke at the end of <a class="textlink"  href="Om.html"><em>Strangelove</em></a> — We'll Meet Again, Don't Know Where, Don't Know When, But You Know We'll Meet Again, Some SUN-NY Day...  A song from the last War.  </p>

<p>Of course we'll meet again.  Totem of our generation, shotgun-rider above our nation, Great Bird of the Sun — how could we possibly <a class="textlink"  href="Grounded.html">go on without it</a>?  </p>

<p>Woe to a people who forsake their gods.  </p>
