<p>"They're chanting something," Thea noticed.  "I can't quite hear what it is.  Turn off the TV will you?"</p>

<p>Veronica pulled the plug and came back to join her on the porch.  By which time they could both hear very clearly what the marchers had to say.  A look of growing distress passed between them.</p>

<p>"Oh shit."</p>
