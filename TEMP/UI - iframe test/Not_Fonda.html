<p>"Bullshit," the Whizzer said in reflex.  Then he thought it over.  "That's right, bullshit," he maintained.  "We're soldiers and we're here by choice.  You signed up to defend the national interest.  You took that oath just like the rest of us.  So now you gotta put your ass on the line â€” or being as you're just a mail sorter, let's say your fingers, toes, and lower back."</p>
