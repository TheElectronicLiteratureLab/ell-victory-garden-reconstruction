<h1>Strange</h1>

<p>"What kind of story do you want?" Emily asked.</p>

<p>Yvonne considered.  "Tell me about your man."</p>

<p>"Sarge," Emily protested, but Yvonne was insistent.  "Tell me about the best time you ever had it.  And don't spare none of the details."</p>

<p>Emily couldn't think of what to say.  "Come on, girl," Yvonne prompted.</p>

<p>"Well okay.  I don't know about the best time, but I'll tell you about the strangest."</p>

<p>The Sergeant laughed.  "Whoa now, that's even better.  What was so strange about it â€” did Boris get rough?  Did he tie you up, or did you tie him up?  Did you whack his behind?  Did he want to watch you make it with another girl?"  She thought further.  "Aw now, he didn't want to piss on you, did he?"</p>
