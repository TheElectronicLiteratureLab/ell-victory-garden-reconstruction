<h1>Trembling on the Brink</h1>

<p>"Here I am having a mental breakdown and what happens, I get students dropping by in the middle of the night to tell me don't worry, be happy." </p>

<p>Jude blew smoke at him.  "You're having a breakdown."</p>

<p>"Fucking right.  Here comes the bless√©d break, all aboard that night train going round the bend.  Check your street clothes with the attendant, next stop the merry land of Pharmacopeia."</p>

<p>He'd got her laughing again.  "Congratulations," she managed.</p>

<p>Urquhart stared at her through the standing smoke.  "Does this seem amusing to you?"</p>
