<h1>Stranger</h1>

<p>I offer to put Miles up in my place, which has a real second bed instead of Thea's folding cot.  Miles is easy to talk to.  Like Thea, like Leroy — like Harley, come to think of it — there's something fundamentally sunny in his makeup.  Also he shares my vice, he's incapable of human behavior till he's had at least 32 ounces of coffee in the mornings.</p>

<p>We spend a lot time talking about Thea's and my book, in which he seems genuinely interested.  We talk about Leroy and his interest in virtual realities, since this is, or used to be, Miles' business.  It turns out that Miles is to a large extent responsible for Leroy's interest in Reality Art.  Miles and <a class="textlink"  href="Forfeit.html">Boris Urquhart</a>.</p>

<p>"What's happened to him anyway?" I ask when the name comes up.  I've never met Boris, but he still seems to mean a lot to Thea.</p>

<p>Miles shrugs.  "Some people's lives are, well, <a class="textlink"  href="Four_O_Clock.html">stranger than others</a>.  He'll be okay."</p>
