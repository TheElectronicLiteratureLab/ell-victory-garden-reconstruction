<h1>Playing Around</h1>

<tt>

<p>Being a woman is supposed to mean being an <a class="textlink"  href="Same_Old_Emily_.html">Other</a>, little sister, and to me that Otherness isn't just negative â€” you can't define a woman as just the opposite of man.  Otherness is something you have to do, a business.  Being a woman means staying out of their games.  It means you have to make up your own game.</p>

<p>I know you go a lot farther with that whole postmodern thing than I do.  Like that crazy Boris of yours you think <u>everything's</u> a game of some sort.  You don't worry about what's unchangeable and final, outside the game.  What's real, not simulated.  You always figure you're going to get another chance, one more time on the field or something I can't do sports metaphors.</p>

<p>I don't know how to explain this to you, Emily, but that's so fucked up.  I really have tried to reach you, kiddo but I really can't understand and sometimes it's so hard for me, so heartbreaking to listen to you, to read what you've written to me</p>
