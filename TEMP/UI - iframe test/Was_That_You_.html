<p>Billy Van inspected his left bootheel.  "You see, Little Runbird," he related, "Ah was over't the Just Say No a little earlier this evenin', and Ah found the place in quite a state.  Folks tole me some real strange shit happened jes' before I got there."</p>

<p>"It's a wild town," Veronica reminded him.</p>

<p>"What Ah heard," Billy Van continued, "was that some filly lookin' very much like yourself went loco in there tonight.  Just a little ol' gal but she slapped some folks around an' smashed th' ol' place up purty good."</p>
