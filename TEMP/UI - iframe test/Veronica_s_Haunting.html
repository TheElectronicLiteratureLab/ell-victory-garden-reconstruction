<h1>Veronica's Haunting</h1>

<p>"Glorious," she said again, but this time with a little edge to it.  "As glorious as all the rest?"</p>

<p>Wake up, Harley, here she comes again.  The floating stopped and he drifted abruptly down to earth.  "What's this?"</p>

<p>"Was it so glorious, for instance, when you used to make it with Thea?"</p>

<p>He tried to massage the tension out of her shoulders but it wouldn't go.  "That was ten years ago.  More," he said quietly.</p>

<p>She held her peace for a while, her body telling him clearly enough that she wasn't pleased.  "I'm sorry," she said finally.  "I know it was a long time ago.  There are just times when I can't help feeling haunted."</p>
