<h1>Computer Reads Dreams!</h1>

<p>They took Urquhart outside the Administration Building and stood him against the wall.  Flash units fired, TV spots glared him down.  Fortunately he remembered his dark glasses.</p>

<p><em>Do you really have a machine that reads dreams?</p>
<p>Is it better than a lie detector?  </p>
<p>Is it true your research was funded by the CIA?</p>
<p>Can it pick up emotions or just logical reasoning? </p>
<p>Can it read Russian or Japanese dreams too? </p>
<p>Is it true your research was funded by TBS? </p>
<p>Are you concerned about the legal and ethical implications? </p>
<p>Any plans to develop the system commercially?</p>

</em><p>Tate was there beside him, smiling and massaging Urquhart's suit collar in amiable fatherly fashion.  "No comment."</p>
