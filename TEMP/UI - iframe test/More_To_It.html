<h1>More To It</h1>

<p>In fact there's <a class="textlink"  href="Ghost.html">more</a> to this whole Boris thing, boss.  More than you probably even suspect.  My life's gotten real complicated lately.  More complicated than I want really.</p>

<p>I dont think this is the right place to be telling you about it, so I'll leave it at that.  But I'd like to have a good long talk with you some time â€”</p>

<p>That's assuming you'll still TALK to me when I get back!  Come on, boss, send us a line or two, will ya?</p>
