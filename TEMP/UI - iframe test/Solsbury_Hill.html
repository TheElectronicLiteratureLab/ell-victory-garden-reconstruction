<h1>Solsbury Hill</h1>
<p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^</p>
<p>Presently a large bright blue angel with civilian markings appears out of the terminator and comes swooping over at a speed just shy of <a class="textlink"  href="Miles_Miles.html">escape velocity</a>.  The angel barrels in, making a noise like a calliope in difficulties.  Its creased neon eyes swivel, scrutinizing the greasy dome of the watchman.  It circles around a few times.  You discern its nostrils in contraction.  It circles a few more times.</p>

<p>You see the surgical steel claws lock into position.</p>

<p>"Oboyoboyoboy," says the watchman, trying not to fidget.</p>

<p>The angel zooms up and snatches you off the tower.</p>
