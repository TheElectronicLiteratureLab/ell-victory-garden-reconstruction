<h1>Not Quite</h1>

<p>"Okay," Yvonne said, "so the second time you got it on it was Cosmic Ecstasy time, right?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly," Emily confessed.  "See, usually when I make love I have this problem."</p>

<p>Yvonne patted her shoulder.  "It just won't happen, huh?"</p>

<p>"Sort of.  If the guy's patient enough I can get real close but I just can't make it all the way.  It's like my body doesn't know what to do next."</p>

<p>"Baby, there ain't a woman breathing who don't know about that."</p>

<p>"Yeah, but it gets stranger.  If the guy's <em>real</em>  good — and Victor and Boris both are — then I actually do get there, or right on the very edge of getting there."</p>
