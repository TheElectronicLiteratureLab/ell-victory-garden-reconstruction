<h1>Red</h1>

<p>Captain Bennie Williams of the U.S. Army 1st Mechanized Infantry Division (the Big Red One) will win the Silver Star for his work in breaching Iraqi defenses in Kuwait.</p>

<p>Tanks under Captain Williams' command are mounted with special plows.  They take up positions on either side of Iraqi trenches, lower their plows, and fill the trenches with sand.  8,000 Iraqi troops are in the trenches.  2,000 surrender before the tanks move in.  Some of the remainder offer active resistance, firing their weapons at the U.S. tanks.</p>

<p>It will not be possible to number the Iraqi dead after this action.  "What you saw was a bunch of buried trenches with people's arms and things sticking out of them," Captain Williams' superior will say.</p>

<p>Colonel Stephen Hawkins, the 1st Division engineer, says the tactic is devised to "<a class="textlink"  href="Sponsor_of_the_Week.html">terrorize</a>" Iraqi troops into surrendering.</p>
