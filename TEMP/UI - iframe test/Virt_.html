<h1>Virtú</h1>

<p>Tate folded Master Johdan's papers reverently and laid them aside.  "Sad to die so young," he reflected, "but you might as well go out as a prophet, eh?"</p>

<p>U blinked, as if remembering something.</p>

<p>"So, Boris," Tate went on, laying an appropriating hand on the younger man's rumpled collar.  "Speaking of prophecies, what would you say to this..."</p>

<p><em>What is the answer to the night? </em></p>

<p>"I've been talking to friends of mine in government and industry," Tate went on.  "The National Research Council, the Council of Economic Advisers, the Trilaterals.  I've proposed that we begin feasibility studies of a virtual economy."</p>
