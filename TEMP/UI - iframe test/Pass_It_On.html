<h1>Pass It On</h1>

<p>"...looks like we've lost our transmission from Bernie Shaw and Peter Arnett in <a class="textlink"  href="Ground_Zero.html">Baghdad</a>, but this was to be expected..."</p>

<p>Somebody pressed something cold into Harley's hand and with a pubcrawler's reflex he brought it up to his mouth, only to discover that he was standing there with a remote control unit pressed to his lips.</p>

<p>A fellow in a Ziggy Marley T-shirt and wingtips gave him a tolerant look.  "Click when you feel like it, then <a class="textlink"  href="Her_Element.html">pass it on</a>."  Harley shut his eyes and pushed a button.</p>

<p>"... if you'd like to put your gas mask on now, we'll understand," Peter Jennings was saying.  "It's <a class="textlink"  href="Ask_the_Marshall.html">your call</a>, as always."</p>

<p>Harley passed it on. </p>
