<h1>Envax Scamdee</h1>

<p>"Dr. Macarthur will be interfacing with our latest prototype Neuro-Verbal Analog Conversion System (NVACS), or as the press insist on calling it, the <a class="textlink"  href="Computer_Reads_Dreams_.html">'dream processor</a>.'  Tonight's session represents our first opportunity to run on the new Ohno-Sendak Superchaotic Analog Matrix Device (SCAMD) with enhanced fuzzy logic.  As you will see, the unique capabilities of this platform allow us to expand significantly the scope of our research."</p>

<p>Urquhart cracked his knuckles tentatively, peering up the table at Tate.  The Provost's expression was unreadable.  Was he amused, bemused, bored?  Urquhart decided it didn't matter.   </p>

<p>"Our time on the SCAMD was provided by DARPA's Behavioral Science Division after the helpful intervention of Provost Tate."</p>

<p>There was brief, decorous applause.</p>
