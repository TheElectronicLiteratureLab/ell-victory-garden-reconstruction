<h1>Tuna Fish</h1>


<p><u>SHAW</u>: "The sky over Baghdad is black.  You can hear an occasional truck or car go by.  But you wouldn't know that there's life outside these windows.  We no longer hear tracer bullets.  We can tell there are fires off in the distance.  It is <em>eerily</em>  quiet right now.  There's a very cool breeze blowing through the window here, and we are <a class="textlink"  href="In_Country.html">sweating... in more ways than one</a>.  Peter... Arnett is here.  John Holliman is here.  Y'know, it occurs to me that I didn't get dinner tonight."</p>

<p><u>HOLLIMAN</u>: "<a class="textlink"  href="Baghdad_in_June.html">We have tuna fish, Bernie, lots of tuna fish.</a>"</p>
