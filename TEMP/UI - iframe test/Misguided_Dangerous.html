<h1>Misguided & Dangerous</h1>

<p>"Oh."  Leroy started to pull off his Nikes but decided he'd wait till his mom had another cigarette.  "Mainly what we talked about was you," he told her.</p>

<p>She finished her bourbon and thought about another but felt reluctant somehow.   "I'm touched.  What could your dear old dad possibly have to say about me?"</p>

<p>"He says you're getting famous because of the Western Civ thing."  Famous, was it?  "He also says he thinks you're misguided and dangerous."</p>

<p>"Good old Frank."</p>

<p>"He says you always were a closet Maoist."</p>

<p>Time was, Thea reflected, when that little description had been a term of endearment.  But that was another century.</p>
