<h1>You Say You Vanna</h1>

<p>Now this Mister Banknotes went forth from Europe spreading the counterfeit gospel of "Revolution," in which we may detect yet a third irony foisted upon us by the Sarpint.  </p>

<p>For until the heretic passed off his baseless coinage, that word appertained only to the <a class="textlink"  href="Wheel.html">Wheel of Fortune</a>, sublime appliance of the goddess Vanna Serutan whose regular circulation provides the steady rise and fall which is the very Peristalsis of Commerce.</p>

<p>The Sarpint's henchman and his followers alienated Revolution from its true and proper context, promulgating a vile distortion that struck at the heart of the holy Contract.  They falsely taught that History is not an eternally cycling Wheel but a linear march or Struggle whose steps are bent (they claimed) toward a People's Utopia â€” though as we know better, it is in fact a serpentine track winding down into Profitless <a class="textlink"  href="Just_Say_No.html">Chaos</a>.</p>
