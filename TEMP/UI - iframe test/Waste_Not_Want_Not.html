<h1>Waste Not Want Not</h1>

<p>"I don't get this shit," the Whizzer bitched.  "We shoved the dumb bastard out of Kuwait, we're using his Republican Guards for a dishrag, heck the Marines and the Rangers are probably <em>in</em>  fucking Baghdad by now.  And he's still throwing this shit at us.  What is <a class="textlink"  href="Point.html">the point</a>?"</p>
