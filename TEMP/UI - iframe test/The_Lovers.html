<h1>The Lovers</h1>

<p>She could look into the mirror just by raising her eyes.  She saw there the lovers.  She saw two pale bodies twined in desire.  She saw the muscles of his shoulders and neck flexed to hold steady.  She saw his arms tight around her hips, his right hand pressed along her pubis, his cheek laid on her downward thigh.  She saw the way her upraised knee was quaking.  She saw the long tapering line of his back, the flat place below his waist, the hard curve of his ass with its dimpled cheeks.  She saw the way his hips pushed up unconsciously as she gave him his pleasure.  She saw the long, thin fingers with their bone-white nails running along his shaft.  She saw the blonde head poised there over his loins, taking and releasing the length of him.  She saw the way his thighs tensed when she ran her tongue over the head of his cock, the way his legs opened when she passed a finger around his scrotum.  In the mirror she saw the two of them making love, the old friends, the impromptu lovers, the tall dark man with the ponytail, the slender blonde with all that unruly hair.  She saw the bodies twined together, saw them move in compensating rhythms, stroke and counterstroke, each desiring the other's desire.  And the more she saw, the stranger she felt about it.</p>
