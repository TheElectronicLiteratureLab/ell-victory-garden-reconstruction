<h1>No Thanks</h1>

<p>Madden dragged a book off the shelf and idly wiped some dust from the binding with his fingertips.  </p>

<p>"Thanks but no thanks, Dr. Heidel.  I don't think the District Director could get behind that one.  The Bureau got enough of a bad aroma from that sort of play back in the fifties.  Even Mister Hoover got his bellyful of <a class="textlink"  href="Exhuming_McCarthy.html">witchhunting</a> at the end."</p>

<p>Heidel gave him that he-doesn't-understand-me look that Madden knew oh so well.  </p>

<p>"You don't get it, do you?"</p>
