<h1>Hippie Chick</h1>

<p>"What do you think about when it happens?" Veronica asked him, gently grazing his collarbone with the tips of her breasts, holding herself otherwise aloof.</p>

<p>"You," Harley said truthfully.  "You, you, glorious you."</p>

<p>She paused, tracing her fingernails down his ventral line.  "You don't see things?"</p>

<p>He considered.  "Stars sometimes.  When I get carried away and hit my head on the bedstead."</p>

<p>"I see big shapes, bright colors," she told him.  "Different ones each time.  Deep blue spirals.  Orange pinwheels.  Fields of yellow flowers."</p>

<p>"Hippie chick," he marveled.</p>
