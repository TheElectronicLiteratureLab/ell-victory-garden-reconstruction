<h1>With Mirrors</h1>

<p>"The trouble is," Jude Busch noted, "what that story has to say about time is really a lot of horseshit.  Time is a garden of possibilities, some kind of cosmic combinatorial, a universal lottery."  She reached over and poked Victor in the ribs.  "I can see how that connects to VR, even if some of us are too slow."</p>

<p>"Time becomes the matrix of all simulations," Amanda put in, her prodigiousness showing.</p>

<p>"Just so," Macarthur encouraged.</p>

<p>"So what?" Victor tossed back.</p>

<p>"Right, what's the point?" Jude said.  "Simulation is one thing, real experience is another.  Borges knew that.  If you ask me he wrote that story as a parlor game.  If that's 'magic realism,' then it's the sort of magic you do with mirrors."  </p>
