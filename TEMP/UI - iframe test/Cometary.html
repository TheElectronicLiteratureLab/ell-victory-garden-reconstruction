<h1>Cometary</h1>

<p>"Probability of what?" Madden asked him.</p>

<p>Tate drew a series of parabolic curves on the whiteboard, their legs bisecting the earth's orbital circle at various points.  Madden looked at them and something in his old school memories clicked.</p>

<p>"Comets?" he said.  "You're working on the probability of a comet passing close to the earth.  What, have you got some dinosaur theory or something?"</p>

<p>Tate considered his drawing critically as if it still lacked something.  "Not comets," he explained.  "Not dinosaurs.  Something much more interesting."</p>

<p>"Like what?"</p>

<p>Tate gestured toward the eyepiece of the telescope, inviting him to look. </p>
