<h1>Our American Way of Life</h1>

<p>Folks, <a class="textlink"  href="By_the_Way_.html">the President's already told you</a> that we didn't go to war in the Gulf to protect no fragile shoots of democracy in Kuwait.  And gee, it looks like we weren't <em>really</em>  fighting to save the world from the fiendish Saddam Hussein, because at this writing he's still over there in Baghdad trying to cut the deal on a sequel.  Of course, some of those nattering nabobs etc. they'll tell you the whole thing was a sham, one big geopolitical smokescreen meant to make the beginnings of a major crash look like just a mild recession.</p>

<p>Have none of it, my friend.  </p>

<p>We all know there was only one reason we jumped in to save the House of Saud's royal Arabian ass.  I know what it was.  You know what it was.  Harley and Urquhart are about to find out, when we get back to them in another sentence or two, just what that shining compelling reason was.  Okay, next screen.</p>
