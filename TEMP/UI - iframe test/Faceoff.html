<h1>Faceoff</h1>

<p>U jumps back into flight, dashes for the farthest corner of the room, ho ho, neat trick in a circular chamber where the faster you run the sooner you end up where you started.  Madden is in the room now fixing U with his heavy gaze and standing there hands in his coat pockets, casual, just real casual now.  Relax, everybody.</p>

<p>"Say, Boris.  Can we talk?"  </p>

<p>The two men are faced off diametrically across the well, twelve to six.  U feints a step to his left.  Madden gets a little jumpy, lunges an inch or so out of pure reflex, but come on, this is a seasoned professional we're dealing with.  He sees what's up, makes a fast break to his own left as U starts to run right.  They stop short, staring.  Standoff.</p>

<p>"Was there a point to all this?"</p>

<p>He had to think about it.</p>
