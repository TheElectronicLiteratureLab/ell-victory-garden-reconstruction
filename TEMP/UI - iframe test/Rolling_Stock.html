<h1>Rolling Stock</h1>

<p>"Let me put it this way â€” what are you driving these days?"</p>

<p>Snyder held up his keys.  "Mercury Grand Mark.  It ain't my old 442, but then my driver's license says I'm not twenty-five anymore, either."</p>

<p>Madden nodded.  "You're a cop, cops always drive cruisers.  But have you had a look at the civilians lately?  Christ, even the fucking Japanese are selling V-8's now.  I go down to Wal-Mart and it's like driving around in some kind of time warp."</p>

<p>Snyder shrugged his beefy shoulders.</p>
