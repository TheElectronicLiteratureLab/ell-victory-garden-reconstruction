<h1>Not Again</h1>

<p>"Maybe I do," Emily allowed.  "I don't know what was happening to me.  I felt kind of like you do after the first time you do it, like I'd lost something I could never get back.  For days I kept seeing these flashes of myself there on the bed with him while that happened to me."</p>

<p>"That's called a fantasy," Yvonne pointed out.  "Did it make you want him?"</p>

<p><a class="textlink"  href="A_Man_Sleeping.html">Emily shook her head</a>.  "I've always liked Victor, he's been a good friend.  I hate myself for fucking up our friendship that way.  He tried to see me again, he's written me letters over here.  But I can't do it."</p>

<p>Yvonne looked her hard in the face.  "Goodness sake, child, why not?"</p>

<p>"Because," Emily said, shutting her eyes, "I can't go through that again.  It felt too much like dying."</p>
