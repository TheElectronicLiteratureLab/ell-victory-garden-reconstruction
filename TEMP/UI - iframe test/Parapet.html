<h1>Parapet</h1>

<p>Jude fought down a spike of panic and cleared her head.  The elevator hadn't moved â€” she would have heard if it had.  The washroom door was closed, as they'd left it.  But the door leading to the stairs was open.  It figured.  She'd gone exploring.</p>

<p>Checking the room quickly for any signs they may have left behind, Jude crossed to the dark doorway and swung herself up the stairs.  The door at the top was ajar.  She went through and found herself on a narrow parapet that ran around the summit of the Tara Tower.  The legendary Thirteenth Floor.</p>

<p>Amanda was leaning on the rail looking out over the quiet campus.  "If the stories are true, more than a dozen people have been killed up here," she said.  "Suicides mostly."</p>

<p>"How cheery.  Let's go."</p>
