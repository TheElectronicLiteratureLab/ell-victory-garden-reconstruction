<h1>Wait, Watch</h1>

<p>He felt disoriented, giddy.  There seemed no purpose to his actions, no fit between himself and the world he moved through.  </p>

<p>There was no one on the streets.  Cars sat idle at the curbs.  From every window the blue glow spilled into the night.  An orgy of watching and waiting.  Thousands of men in the air, on the ground and the sea, and all that really is happening is <a class="textlink"  href="Emily.html">television</a>.</p>

<p>They sat in their living rooms, they lay in their bedrooms waiting for the words, the pictures, the news.  Waiting for the bombs to fall, waiting for the rockets to fly.</p>

<p>Waiting, watching for the message.</p>

<p>And a voice inside him said <em>U must deliver the message, U must find the answer.</em></p>
