<h1>Very Sad</h1>

<p>"Who?" U wondered.</p>

<p>"Such ignorance," Tate scolded him. "Master Johdan was one of the greatest Japanese intellectuals of the wartime period.  His was best known as an economist, though he was also a philosopher, poet, and disciple of Zen."</p>

<p>"Never heard of him."</p>

<p>Tate shook his head.  "Such a shame.  He died young and at the wrong time, and his work's been badly neglected.  It was November, 1945.  Johdan was awaiting trial for war crimes, though there's little doubt he would have been cleared and rehabilitated.  But such bad luck.  A week before the trial he suffered a fatal seizure, most likely a stroke.  He was only 43.  Very sad."</p>
