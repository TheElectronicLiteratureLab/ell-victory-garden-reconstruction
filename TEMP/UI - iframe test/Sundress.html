<h1>Sundress</h1>
<tt>
<p>I am scared for you, Emily, but what scares me most isn't the bombs or the gas.  As you said it's the changes, and what scares me most is the thought of <u>you</u> <a class="textlink"  href="War_Games.html">changing</a>.</p>

<p>What will you be like when I see you again?  Will you be the same old Emily, lazy and smart-assed as ever?  Are we going to slide back into the life we had, staying up past closing in the No and bitching about everything that's rotten in Tara.  Are we still going to have our Sunday afternoons at the Creek, drinking too much of that wine and hiding the car keys from Urquhart. Will I ever get to see you in that silly old sundress of mine again?</p>

<p>forget this</p>
