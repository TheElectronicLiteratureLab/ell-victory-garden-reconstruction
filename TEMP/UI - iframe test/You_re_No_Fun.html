<h1>You're No Fun</h1>

<p>"This isn't about getting a rush," Jude reminded her as soberly as she could.  "It's about <a class="textlink"  href="Postindustrial.html">information</a>."</p>

<p>"What good is information if there's no fun in it?"</p>

<p>Jude clapped her hand over her co-conspirator's mouth.  Footsteps, slow and measured, coming their way.  She eased the stairway door closed and folded herself into the shadows.  A second or two later the watchman's hand tried the knob and found it secure.  She heard the footsteps again, receding.</p>

<p>"This should be all kinds of fun," Jude murmured.  "Assuming we find what I'm looking for up there."  She pushed her key back into the doorknob, turned the tumblers silently, eased the door open a crack, reconnoitering.</p>
