<h1>Not Right</h1>
<tt>
<p>Dear Emily â€” It seems true, as you always suspected, that my mind isn't right.</p>

<p>This is not right.  </p>

<p>Maybe this is not meant for you after all, Emily, maybe I'm just talking to myself again, talking to myself...</p>

<p>I get these fits, starting out as ordinary vertigo with the racing pulse and the catch in his brain like dope or something.</p>

<p>A <a class="textlink"  href="Reflex.html">swarming</a>.</p>
