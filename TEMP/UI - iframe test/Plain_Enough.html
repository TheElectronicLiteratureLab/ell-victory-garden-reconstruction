<h1>Plain Enough</h1>

<p>"The Garden of Forking Paths is pure fantasy," Jude concluded.  "It has nothing to do with history or human experience.  It's all a nice, self-contained game.  Like your VR."</p>

<p>Macarthur stared.  "You don't think you're taking kind of a narrow view... ?"</p>

<p>"We're linear animals.  We're born; we live; we die.  That's pretty much inescapable.  We make choices, we take the consequences.  As for your hypertexts and multiple simulations, well how nice for you.  But what do they mean in the real world?"</p>

<p>"A world with real problems," Amanda reminded.</p>

<p>"A world that's about to have another war," Victor put in.</p>

<p>"Hardly seems a good time to be running away into fantasy," Jude pointed out.</p>
