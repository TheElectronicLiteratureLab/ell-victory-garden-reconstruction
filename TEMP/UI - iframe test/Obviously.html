<h1>Obviously</h1>

<p>"Anyway, about four o'clock Victor got up to move to the couch.  He tried not to wake me but I wasn't really asleep.  At first I didn't understand why he was leaving.  Then he crossed into the light and suddenly it was obvious."</p>

<p>"Like about this obvious?"</p>

<p>"Like even more than that."  Yvonne raised an eyebrow.</p>

<p>"So at that point I told myself, this is ridiculous, you went home with this guy so that you could make love, he obviously wants to, what the hell's wrong with you?"</p>

<p>Yvonne nodded agreement.  "Now you talking sense."</p>

<p>"So I got up and kissed him and asked him to make love with me."</p>
