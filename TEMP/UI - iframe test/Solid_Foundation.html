<h1>Solid Foundation</h1>
<em>
</em><p>LK:  <em>Professor Heidel, in 1989 you founded a group called the Educational Freedom Foundation, whose charter reads in part: 'We will work to expose and oppose special interests and left-wing pressure groups whenever they become a threat to academic freedom.'  Could you tell us more about the E.F.F. and its activities?</em></p>

<p>EH:  <em>The Foundation is just an association of concerned scholars from around the country.  We depend on volunteer effort and some <a class="textlink"  href="Aftermath.html">modest support from private charities.</a>  We publish a newsletter and coordinate with media and opinion leaders to reveal undemocratic and restrictive practices like those of the Agnew Committee on my campus.</em></p>

<p>LK:  <em>Do you draw a salary as head of this group?</p>

</em><p>EH:  <em>No I don't Larry, though I do have a small support budget to take care of <a class="textlink"  href="Letters.html">printing, mailing</a>, and miscellaneous overhead.</em></p>
