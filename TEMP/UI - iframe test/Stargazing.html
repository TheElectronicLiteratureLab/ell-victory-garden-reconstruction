<h1>Stargazing</h1>

<p>Madden blinked up into the semi-darkness.  "Hello?"  Tate sat in the cage, looking and thinking, oblivious.  </p>

<p>Constructed in the forties, this old telescope was a museum piece, the quality of its 180-inch mirror long ago offset by the antiquity of its mechanism and light pollution from the growing city.  The University's main research facility lay a hundred and fifty miles away across the prairie, far from the glare of the urban belt. </p>

<p>Even that newer instrument was falling into neglect these days, with most of the University's astronomers frantically trying to retrieve scientific salvage from the Hubble disaster.  No one was doing much old-fashioned stargazing.  The old observatory drew only a few dozen students on most days, and these lately not from Astronomy but from the new History of Science program.</p>

<p>Most nights, like tonight, Tate had the place all to himself.</p>
