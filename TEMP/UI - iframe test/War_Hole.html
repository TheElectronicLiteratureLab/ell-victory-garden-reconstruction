<h1>War Hole</h1>

<p>The Whizzer had a look around the bivouac.  "Okay, so it ain't the Beverly Hilton.  Just what are you getting at, Dickster?"</p>

<p>"This war is our chance to be The Other Guy," Dexter explained.  "It makes sense. This is the way we're all gonna be in the nineties.  Remember how Andy War Hole said everyone's supposed to get fifteen minutes of fame?  Well some fucking genius he was, he got it wrong.  It's not fifteen minutes of fame, it's fifteen minutes of <em>fear</em> ."</p>

<p>The other man considered.  "In that case can I go home now?  Seems like my fifteen minutes must be up."</p>
