<p>Your speed now exceeds rated limits of any and all available braking surfaces.</p>

<p>You are going to crash.</p>

<p>The rostrum looms up at you, closer & closer & bigger & bigger.  The figure on the rostrum stands immobile, his arms still raised.  Now he's not above you anymore but somehow he stands <a class="textlink"  href="Plane.html">in the plane of your trajectory</a>, straight in your way.</p>

<p>You are going to crash into him.</p>

<p>You try backpedaling, as if that would do any good ha ha, but your feet are no longer in contact with anything you could call terra firma.  Closer & closer, faster & faster, the walls and faces around you a bleeding blur.</p>
