<h1>West</h1>

<p>Urquhart turned to the opposite wall.  The display there was partitioned into four unequal rectangles.  One window showed the moving wave tracks from the EEG.  There looked to be a lot of curious activity along the <a class="textlink"  href="See_Hear.html">alpha trace</a>.  A second window contained a real-time contour map, updated on the half-second, tracing the interaction of several mysterious variables: skin conductivity, blood cholesterol, Amazon deforestation.  It looked like the crinkled surface of a strange planet.  In the third window was the obligatory Mandelbrot image, totally irrelevant but fun to stare at when the <a class="textlink"  href="Endgame.html">demo</a> got boring.  </p>

<p>The largest window, dead center in the screen, was filled with flickering strings of words.</p>

<p>"NVACS," Urquhart announced.  "The other player in tonight's game."</p>
