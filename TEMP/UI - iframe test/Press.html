<h1>Press</h1>

<p>"What's the matter, Todd?" the distant voice called over.</p>

<p>The cop who'd taken Harley's wallet turned his head.  "Jesus, Sarge, this one's working press."</p>

<p>A silence ensued.  Harley sank to his knees, sick to his stomach.</p>

<p>"Local paper, radio?" the sergeant asked.  "He don't look familiar."</p>

<p>"Oh shit no," Harley's second assailant chimed in, turning Harley's press card to the light.  "He's fucking CNN!"</p>

<p>"Bullshit."</p>

<p>"No, look."</p>

<p>"Oh Christ."</p>
