<h1>Fool's Errand</h1>

<p>Tate examined what his light revealed: Uqbari the Prophet come calling.  When, he wondered idly, did the poor boy start working door-to-door?  Tate shook his head.  Tonight, he reflected, was a night of strange appearances â€” out there by the Lagrangian points, over in the Arabian sky, and now right here on his doorstep.  A night of strange changes.</p>

<p>"Boris," Tate said by way of greeting.</p>

<p>U said nothing, just stood there immobile, staring.  Presently Tate noticed the rents in his clothing, the <a class="textlink"  href="Mad.html">blood</a> on his face.</p>

<p>"For heaven's sake, what fool's errand have you been on?"  He pushed the door open and ushered U into the entryway.  They passed into the dome.</p>
