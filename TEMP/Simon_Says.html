<h1>Simon Says</h1>

<p>10:34 EST — Bob Simon of CBS reports that the Iraqis have begun shelling refinery sites along the northern border of Saudi Arabia.  Simon claims he's heard that Saudi troops began falling back even before the attack began in earnest.  The Saudis' willingness to fight has always been questionable, Simon gloomily notes, and now our worst suspicions may be realized.  </p>

<p>The <a class="textlink"  href="Kind_of_Scary.html">Bad-News Bearer</a> — the networks' answer to pool journalism and the gun-camera feed: just go out there and hang them with the truth.</p>

<p>Is it a hunger for more of these Tales of Snafu that will lure Simon and his crew over the Kuwaiti border just a few days hence and end them up as Iraqi P.O.W.'s?</p>

<p>This time, Bob, it really is their war.</p>
