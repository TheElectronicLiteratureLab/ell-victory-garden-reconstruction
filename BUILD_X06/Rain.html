<p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^</p>
<p>Rain. </p>
<p>The proximity of a fluid.  </p>
<p>A general moistness to the environment.</p>

<p>This is a deep cue triggering powerful memories.  It takes you <a class="textlink"  href="Watch_My_Back.html">back</a>, far back.  If you permit, it will take you back all the way to where you can't know where, but you don't need to go that far.  You need only go as far as Paramus, New Jersey, a small warehouse and business park off 287 where there is a door marked InnerFace Associates.  That's right, the <a class="textlink"  href="Floater.html">tank farm</a>.  You are going Inside again.  You remember very clearly what Inside is like.  Dark, warm, still.  Then gone for a while.  Maybe a long while but probably not a long while.  </p>
<p>Pleasant.  Gone.</p>

<p>Then not so gone. Not so dark or still.  </p>
<p>Begin to <a class="textlink"  href="See_Hear.html">see</a>.</p>
