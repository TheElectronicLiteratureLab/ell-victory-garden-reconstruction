<h1>Reprimand</h1>

<p>"From the look on your face you might have been expecting some <a class="textlink"  href="Loose_Lips.html">New Right death squad</a>," Urquhart observed, rubbing his leg as she scooted past.</p>

<p>"Boris, I understand that you're from another planet and I try to compensate, really I do.  But look: while picking the locks on your colleagues' doors may be something you computer scientists do all the time as a jolly little lark, over here in Humanities we still think of it as, oh, I dunno, a <a class="textlink"  href="Insanity.html">criminal offense</a>."</p>

<p>Urquhart put on his sunglasses.  "Try to forgive me."</p>
