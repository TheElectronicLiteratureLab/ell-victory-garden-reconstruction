<h1>Warning</h1>

<p>"This is truly amazing," Tate said, speaking for his own benefit again.  "I'd ask you to join me in the cage," he apologized, "but there's very little room here and I'm not sure that what you'd see would make sense to you."</p>

<p>Heidel snapped his briefcase shut, incensed.  "I'm sorry," he said, "but I didn't come all the way out here to look at the planets.  I came to warn you about what you'll find in Monday's mail."</p>

<p>There was another longish pause.  "Wesley handles the mail," Tate said.  "Why don't you speak to him?"</p>

<p>Heidel picked up his case and readied himself to go.  "I believe this matter demands your most direct and serious attention," he insisted.  "But if you'd rather discuss it later, you know where I can be reached."</p>
