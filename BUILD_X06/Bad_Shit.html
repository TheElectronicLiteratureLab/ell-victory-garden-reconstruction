<h1>Bad Shit</h1>
<i>
<p>I'd laugh but I'm not sure it's funny.  Have you lost your mind, Heidel?</p>

<p>I'm quite sane and I'm not joking, Thea. </i></p>

<p>No he wasn't, but surely he ought to be.  Unless something was grotesquely wrong.  Thea.</p>

<p>Heidel on a first-name basis?  He was patronizing, yes.  Doing it to antagonize? â€” no, that didn't make sense.  Heidel was too big a coward to come spoiling for a fight.  Anyone knew that to patronize Thea Agnew was to goad her, and Heidel wouldn't goad unless he felt sure of winning.  Or unless he'd already won.</p>

<p>Her head spun a little.  This could be bad shit, Thea.</p>
