<h1>Kuralt</h1>

<p>8:40 EST â€” Charles Kuralt, veteran reporter of Vietnam and the American road, shares a few moments with Dan Rather.  After five months of warning, he reflects, we are still having trouble absorbing the news that "this war that nobody wanted has begun."</p>

<p>Kuralt's crew has been covering a basketball game between Duke and The Citadel.  Shortly after 7:00 the P.A. announcer somewhat prematurely declared "the liberation of Kuwait."  Wild cheering from the South Carolina crowd.</p>
