<p>"The real reason," Harley mused, "is that I think the war is not the main story.  Why should I go to Bahrain or Saudi when the big story is right here in the good old U.S.A.?"</p>

<p>Madden broke a chunk off Harley's half-uneaten baguette.  "And just what is this big story on the homefront?  You can't mean all that Stop the War shit we saw down at the Capitol this morning."</p>

<p>Harley shook his head.  "Nah. The whole thing's being managed too carefully.  The opposition is just a media show so far."</p>

<p>"Okay," Madden agreed, "so where's the story?"</p>
