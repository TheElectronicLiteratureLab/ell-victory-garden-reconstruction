<h1>Beige</h1>

<p>Harley struggled up to a sitting posture, locking his hands behind the small of her back, holding her to him, her legs wrapped tight around his hips.  "What colors do I make you see?"</p>

<p>"Mostly pastels so far," she teased him.  "Lots of beige."</p>

<p>"Bullshit."  He kissed her.</p>

<p>"Mauve.  Platinum.  Tasteful beige."</p>

<p>"Caf√© au lait.  Copper pennies.  Deep Dutch chocolate."</p>

<p>She took him inside her and they put the world away.</p>
