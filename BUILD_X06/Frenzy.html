<p>Urquhart stepped into the light again and it was like walking back through the doors of an asylum.</p>

<p><i>Hi there!  Welcome once more to the world of the mad, we're  </i>so<i> glad to see you again!</p>
<p>Meanwhile in the Persian Gulf...</i></p>

<p>A babble of voices washed over him, reporting, summarizing, intoning, chanting.  All those many voices saying over and over again the same things.  All those voices...</p>

<p>In the living room, deep in the heart of it all, sat <a class="textlink"  href="East.html">Miles Macarthur</a>.  He was clearly engaged in some kind of feeding frenzy.</p>
