<h1>What's It Mean?</h1>

<p>"But if it's a code," Thea pointed out, "then it must all mean something.  What do you think it means?"</p>

<p>"That's what I'd like to ask Jack."</p>

<p>Oh no, thought Thea, not so fast, kiddo.  "Forget Jack."  She found a reasonably fresh pack of cigarettes under a sofa cushion, shook one out and lit up.  "He had his own problems.  You're the one who's just been to America, what did you find there?  What did you find cooking out there in the national gene-pool?"</p>

<p>Leroy shrugged.  "Are we going to talk politics now?"</p>

<p>Thea drew in her chin.  "Roy.  Do we ever do that?"</p>

<p>"Do we ever not."  But this time he smiled when he said it.</p>
