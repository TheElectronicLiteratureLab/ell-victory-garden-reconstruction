<h1>Homefront</h1>

<p><a class="textlink"  href="Absence_of_Boris.html">Amanda</a> Fairbairn was standing there obviously antsy, shifting from foot to foot like a sprinter, fingers at the zipper of her midnight blue jumpsuit.  Inching it midway down her sternum as they peered around the doorway at the security man.  "Now?"</p>

<p>Jude put her fingers to her lips.  "Keep your pants on."</p>

<p>"Aw."</p>

<p>Jude grabbed her young accomplice by the shoulders and pulled her back into the stairwell.  "Jeez," she whispered, "you're really hot to do it, aren't you?"</p>

<p>Amanda nodded with a sort of crazed enthusiasm.  "What a rush."</p>

<p>Jude rolled her eyes.</p>
