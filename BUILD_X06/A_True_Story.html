<h1>A True Story</h1>

<p>"You scared, <a class="textlink"  href="Sisters.html">Runbird</a>?" Sergeant Yvonne asked.</p>

<p>"Aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Shit no.  Takes more than the lights gone out to make me wet my skivvies."  She leaned back against Emily's shoulder.  "Tell you what I am, though, is bored.  This is a major drag if you know what I mean, sittin' all night in the goddamn dark.  Ain't very entertaining, is it."</p>

<p>Emily agreed it was a drag.  "So read us a story, Runbird.  See if you can find <a class="textlink"  href="Blood_Guts_in_S_A_.html">that crazy bitch's book</a> your man Boris sent over."</p>

<p>"I can't read in this light."</p>

<p>"All right, so tell us a story then.  Tell us a true story." </p>
