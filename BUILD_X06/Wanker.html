<p>Amanda shot him a really dirty look.  "Speak for yourself, buddy.  I may only be fifteen and a half but I do have two advanced degrees in Electrical Engineering and I know things about masturbation that are beyond <a class="textlink"  href="Rain.html">your dampest dreams</a>."</p>

<p>Macarthur shook his head.  "Grad school sure has changed in the year and a half since I was there."</p>
