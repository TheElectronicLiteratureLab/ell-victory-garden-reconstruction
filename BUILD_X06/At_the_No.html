<h1>At the No</h1>

<p>Urquhart goosed the Porsche onto East Main without even thinking of looking behind him, then jammed on the brakes and brought the car to a stop, body swaying with frustrated inertia.</p>

<p>Harley Morgan was leaning on the front fender of somebody's Jeep, looking concerned.  He recognized his car and his eyes went wide.</p>

<p>"Motherfucker!" he yelled, scrambling off the curb.</p>

<p>Urquhart put his head out the window.  "Get in."</p>

<p>Harley stopped dead, stone poleaxed by the sight of Uqbari the Car-Thieving Prophet.</p>

<p>"Hurry up," Urquhart.  "They can't be far behind me."</p>
