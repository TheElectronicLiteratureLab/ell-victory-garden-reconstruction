<h1>Welcome</h1>

<p>Victory Garden is a hypertext — a story, or a web of stories, whose contours can change every time you read it.</p>

<p>You move through the text by pressing the Return key to progress from one moment to another, as you would turn the pages of a book.  Click the Back arrow (on the bar below) to review the previous moment, or to move back through the story as you've seen it so far.  If you read in this way the story will generally keep within certain discrete lines or pathways — though these pathways themselves may shift or change.</p>

<p>At most moments you can also double-click certain words ("words that yield") which will carry you to a different story line.  Though yield-words often create discontinuities, they also map connections.</p>
