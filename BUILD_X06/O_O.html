<h1>O.O</h1>
<p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^</p>
<p><i>The thing about rainbows</i>  a voice says inside your head <i>is their ability to create an anomalous space â€” not quite here, not quite not here </i>.  </p>

<p>You are looking very hard at the rainbow.  Usually when you do that it will fade away.  If you stare very hard without blinking the colors become less noticeable, they wander off somehow into other categories of aeriality and skyness.  </p>

<p>But this time when you gaze into the rainbow something goes wrong and the reality of its space does not diminish, rather it grows and substantiates and overwhelms you.  You are staring into unspace, which is not a wise thing to do, because lo, the deeper you stare the more confused you become, the more difficult you find it is to draw <a class="textlink"  href="Distinctions.html">essential distinctions</a>.  You want to make this curious state of affairs go away, and now indeed you feel that something is starting to fade.  Only the rainbow isn't fading.  <a class="textlink"  href="Embarked.html">The rainbow persists</a>.  What disappears</p>
                                                  <p>is</p>
