<h1>Sinking Feeling</h1>
<p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^</p>
<p>Since you fell into this general oceanic condition you seem to have <a class="textlink"  href="Going_UP_.html">sunk</a> a great way.</p>

<p>You look up and there's the sun looking like a cheap fresnel behind a lot of blue-green gels.  You go down and down all the while reflecting that it's a good thing this is a dream because otherwise you'd probably look like a squeezed-out sponge about now, not to mention the fact that your lungs would be full of water.  </p>

<p>And maybe they are, but like the poet says, you breathe differently down here.  </p>

<p>And sure enough there it is, eleven dozen fathoms below the soles of your Nikes â€” the Wreck.</p>
