<p>Generally speaking Madden had nothing against those good citizens who would call him up now and then for a business chat.  Nevermind what he'd learned as a kid about loyalty and fair play.  Call them informants, call them informers — call them snitches, turncoats, deep sources — they were an essential part of his work.  </p>
