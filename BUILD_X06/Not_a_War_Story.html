<h1>Not a War Story</h1>

<p>"Okay, if you have to know.  I was expelled from Bryn Mawr after I punched out the head of the Chemistry Department."</p>

<p><a class="textlink"  href="Hi_Mom.html">Leroy</a> looked appreciative.  "Did you really?"</p>

<p><a class="textlink"  href="Thea_s_War.html">Thea</a> lit another cigarette and shook out the match.  "Left hook.  I really cleaned the poor man's clock."</p>

<p>Leroy tried to reconstruct the action, carrying her left fist up to his own jaw.  He shook his head disbelievingly.  "Why'd you do it, Mom?"</p>

<p>Thea flushed.  "I'm so glad you got around to that, kiddo â€” this isn't one of your Grandpa Agnew's war stories, remember.  It turns out I did it for no good reason at all."</p>

<p>"Say what?"</p>
