<h1>Plane Geometry</h1>

<p>Tate smiled, cross-checking the badge against its bearer.  "That's all I'm talking about, plane geometry."  He picked up a portable whiteboard from a jumble of books and papers, slipped a marking pen from his pocket and drew two large circles.</p>

<p>"Our general neighborhood," he said, "the orbit of our planet around the sun."  Tangent to this circle he drew a second circle, more of a fat dot really, as tight as the pen point would allow.  "Call that the orbit of the moon around the earth.  This drawing is grossly distorted but it should give some sense of the scale."</p>

<p>"Okay." Madden was more or less amused by this unexpected astronomy lesson.  Why not?  Unlike most people, he had no desire to go home and wallow in the war news; and the business end of tonight's conversation wouldn't be much fun.  If Tate wanted to play Carl Sagan, let him go ahead.  "So what's this all mean?" Madden asked.</p>

<p>Tate tapped the whiteboard.  "Probability and coincidence," he replied.</p>
