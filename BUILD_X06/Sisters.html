<h1>Sisters</h1>

<p>Thea studied Veronica's face in the flare of a long drag.  There was concern in her face tonight, along with what looked like raw weariness â€” as if, this early on, she'd already been in some <a class="textlink"  href="Your_Generation.html">tight scrape</a>.  The resemblance to <a class="textlink"  href="Dear_You.html">Emily</a> was vivid: the same high cheekbones and long, stepped <a class="textlink"  href="On_the_Nose.html">nose</a>, the ash-blonde complexion a shade more delicate in the younger sister.  Emily was the slender, elegant one driven crazy by endless comparisons to <a class="textlink"  href="Missing.html">La Streep</a>.  Veronica's looks were less easily put down to type, a touch androgynous like a <a class="textlink"  href="Going_West.html">femme Lennon</a>, especially in these granny glasses she'd taken to wearing.    </p>

<p>She was somewhere in her early twenties: straight, tall, strong, wide in the hips but oddly girlish in her moves, given to compulsive awkwardness as if she were <a class="textlink"  href="Miles_in_Nature.html">trying to keep her real grace under wraps</a>.</p>

<p>Sometimes, Thea reflected, looking at Veronica was like watching a projection of herself <a class="textlink"  href="Watch_My_Back.html">reeled back</a> from <a class="textlink"  href="Not_a_War_Story.html">twenty-five years past</a>.</p>
