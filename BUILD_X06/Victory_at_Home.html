<h1>Victory at Home</h1>

<p>The unit's outstanding Gulf service played a major part in its preservation.  Forty percent of the flyers and medics in the outfit are veterans of Vietnam.  Their lengthy experience in Hueys, particularly in night operations, brought them to the particular attention of the Pentagon brass.  </p>

<p>Had the unit been deactivated or transferred, the neighborhood would have lost between three and four hundred jobs.</p>

<p>It's another sort of war story, <a class="textlink"  href="By_the_Way_.html">a different kind of victory</a>  to celebrate.</p>
