<h1>Strategy</h1>

<p>Amanda got ready with that zipper again and Jude was thinking, Oh shit just my style, taking an underage exhibitionist along on a high-security breakin.  But still, if you happened to need a handy diversion...</p>

<p>The plan was simple enough.  Victor's key to the utility tunnel got them into the Tower; the next sticking point was the twenty-four-hour guard on the security desk in the lobby.  A little streaking episode, they figured, ought to distract the desk man long enough for Jude to slip over to the <a class="textlink"  href="Parley.html">Presidential elevator</a>.</p>

<p>Jude had her reservations, though.  Mainly she didn't like the risk to Amanda if she was caught.  Also she could use a lookout and maybe an extra hand for the upstairs phase of the operation.  She pulled back her kaffiyeh and put her ear to the door.  What she heard left her with confused feelings.  Dismay, anger, shock â€” but for the moment, a kind of relief.</p>
