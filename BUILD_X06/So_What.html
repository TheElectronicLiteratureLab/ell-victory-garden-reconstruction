<h1>So What</h1>
<p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^</p>
<p>You have always wondered why people make such a fuss about Rainbowsâ„¢.  </p>

<p>Covenant, spectrum, proscenium, Asgard bypass, shell of the cosmic egg.  Yeah and while you're at it pull the other one.</p>

<p>Except in Seattle, the Emerald City, where you saw one that filled up half the sky and was almost surely the true sublime, but when you brought this to the attention of your native guide he said, "Oh, right, yeah, those."  </p>

<p>In the age of momentary miracles you just have to live with Inflation.</p>

<p>You look very hard at the rainbow, but this one won't go away.</p>
