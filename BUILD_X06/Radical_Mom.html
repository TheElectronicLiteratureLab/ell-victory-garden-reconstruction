<h1>Radical Mom</h1>

<p>"Were you ever arrested?" Leroy wanted to know.</p>

<p>"Jesus what is this, an FBI interview?  No I was never arrested, not once, not even on Moratorium Day when Nixon popped half of Washington, D.C. without due process.  Commit that one to memory: unconstitutional arrests; massive violations of civil rights."</p>

<p>Leroy made obedient scribbling motions.  "Yes ma'am, got it, <a class="textlink"  href="National_Dick.html">he<i>was</i>  a crook after all</a>.  But what about you, you're telling me you never did anything really outrageous?"</p>

<p>Thea eyed her son narrowly.  "Why do I suspect your father's hand in this little inquisition?"</p>

<p>The boy did his best to look innocent.  "I was just curious about why you got thrown out of college."</p>
