<h1>The White Suit</h1>

<p>Listening to those voices in his head, like this one says I AM A SCIENTIST EMILY YOU KNOW THAT ABOUT ME.  No visionary, no mystic, no shaman.  </p>

<p>That was mere foolishness, low delusion, simple sentimental <a class="textlink"  href="Know_About_That.html">paranoia</a>.  He is what he has striven to be: the Scientist, the Man In The White Suit, what U know about that?  What can anyone know about anything?  O man, spare us these Questions.  Why not, what do any of you have but questions?  Knowledge arises out of complex discursive transactions,  knowledge comprises itself in complex recursive interactions.  Here we go again.</p>

<p>We make it up as we make it up, more-than-half-creating what we perceive.  And this is news?  Well...  </p>

<p>And so here we sit in this po' moment, two reels deep in the Return of the Twilight of the Idols, and what we know above all is that we are but shadows here, poor players.  But really, folks, ya gotta love...</p>
