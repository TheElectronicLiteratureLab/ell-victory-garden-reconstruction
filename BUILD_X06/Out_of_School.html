<p>"They really threw you out, huh?"</p>

<p>"On my ass, and irrevocably.  Folks were getting expelled right and left those days and most of them got to come back after a year or two on the straight.  But somehow the College couldn't manage to forgive me.  Young ladies weren't supposed to be quick with their fists."</p>

<p>"Gee, Mom.  Did you ever beat up on Dad?"</p>

<p>She gave him the narrowest of glares.</p>

<p>"Joshing, really."  He put up his hands and mimed some counterpunches.  "So after Bryn Mawr you spent a few years hanging out, right?"</p>
