<h1>Some Kind of Crisis</h1>

<p>Jude swung her chair back to the level, got up and leaned against the far edge of  the desk.  "You really can trust me, Dr. U.  I'm kind of like family with the Runbirds.  Veronica and I went to school together back in Eustace and I've known Emily since I first came to town.  She's the one who talked me into taking your classes.  She's a good friend of mine and I know you care about her.  That makes me want to help." </p>

<p>She picked at a letter lying midway down in the desktop detritus.  It was half dissolved with five or six other pieces of paper into some kind of gummy mass.  </p>

<p>"Are we looking at a mid-life crisis here, Dr. U.?"</p>

<p>Urquhart weighed the possibility.  "Crisis yes.  I have certain problems with the modifier."</p>
