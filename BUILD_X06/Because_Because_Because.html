<h1>Because Because Because</h1>




                        <p>Because she wasn't lost.</p>

<p>Because the war stopped as strangely and suddenly as it began.</p>

               <p>Because she did come home.</p>

                                                  <p>Because (la-la) how the life goes on...</p>
