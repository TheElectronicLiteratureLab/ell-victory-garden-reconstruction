<p>Thea went to the kitchen and poured the interdict beer down the disposer, removing temptations.  She felt a little dizzy, mainly from the bourbon but partly from the company.  She almost hadn't recognized him this time, he'd grown so much — but once he started talking there could be no mistake.  He was still Leroy the surprising boy, growing up as fast as he could, challenging her to make the world make sense.</p>

Among other things, it meant an ability to criticize the existing culture — its history, its values, its imagination.  An ability to see a difference and make a difference."</p>
