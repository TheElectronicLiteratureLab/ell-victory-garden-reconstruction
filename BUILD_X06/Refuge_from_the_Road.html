<h1>Refuge from the Road</h1>

<p>"Kind of short on romance, was it?" Thea asked, giving in and fetching him another beer.</p>

<p>"It was plain depressing," Leroy admitted.  "I spent three days trying to get a ride out of Dallas.  In the end I had to get on the 'Hound."</p>

<p>Somehow this wasn't a surprise.  The jeans he had on looked stiff enough to stand in the corner and the clothes spilled from his backpack were ranker still.  His underwear (both pairs) were truly unmentionable.  He smelled of diesel, truckstop grease, and many many days of sweat.  Hardly the right fashion statement for Big D, that gaudy and self-righteous buckle on the Bible Belt.</p>

<p>"I don't think your Jack ever went to Dallas," Thea observed.</p>

<p>"From what I saw," Leroy concluded, "he wasn't even in the same country."</p>
