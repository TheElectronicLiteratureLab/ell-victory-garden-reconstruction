<p>How is it we all have the same name? you think to ask but before you can get your mouth open the leetle feller has jetted off in a flurry of helium giggles <i>tee—heeheeheeheehee</i> ,  etc.</p>

<p>Boris T. Agnew strolls out onto the balcony just above your head.  He is masked with the face of David Letterman, or is it Jimmy Carter, or is it Howdy Doody? — Shhhh, Boris says, don't think so loud.  Jude S. Agnew moves out of the shadows.  — They might hear you, she cautions.</p>

<p>The floor undergoes some kind of paradigm shift and there you are on the balcony with them, admiring the waterfall with its colorful salmon ropers.  </p>
