<em>The thing about rainbows</em> a voice says inside your head <em>is their ability to create an anomalous space -- not quite here, not quite not here.</em>
</p><p>
You are looking very hard at the rainbow.  Usually when you do that it will fade away.  If you star very hard without blinking the colors become less noticeable. they wander off somehow into other categories of aeriality and skyness.

You are staring into unspace, which is not a wise thing to do, because lo, the deeper you stare the more confused you become, the more difficult you find it to draw
