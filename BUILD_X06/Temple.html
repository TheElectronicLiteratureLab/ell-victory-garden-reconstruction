<h1>Temple</h1>

<p>Using his provostial influence, Tate had turned the old observatory into his unofficial workshop.  The inside of the dome was now a strange combination of working observatory and private reading room.  On this level the floor was just a few yards wide, surrounding a deep well sunk into the foundations to make room for the telescope mount.  U looked at the giant cylinder pointing up through the ceiling.  It had been in use recently: some of the weather panels were still rolled back.</p>

<p>"It's been <a class="textlink"  href="Interesting.html">interesting viewing tonight</a>," Tate explained.  "Rare things indeed."</p>

<p>U walked over to the edge of the platform.  An iron railing and a plain wooden workbench ran around the well.  All around the room, nearly every inch on the bench was covered with books, papers, charts, boxes, computers, machinery, detritus.</p>
