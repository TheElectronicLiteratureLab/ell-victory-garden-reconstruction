<h1>Sister Emily</h1>

<p>Harley struggled up to a sitting posture, locking his hands behind the small of her back, holding her to him, her legs wrapped tight around his hips.  "Do you know, my sister Emily's never had it."</p>

<p>He was tracing curves and circles below her shoulderblades.  "Had what?"</p>

<p>"You know.  The big O."</p>

<p>It was getting very hard for Harley to pay attention to this conversation, primarily because this wasn't the only thing getting very hard.  "You're kidding."  </p>

<p>She shook her head.  "Claims it's too scary for her."</p>
