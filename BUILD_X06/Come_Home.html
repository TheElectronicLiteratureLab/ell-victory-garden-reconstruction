<h1>Come Home</h1>
<tt>

<p>This war isn't right, it's evil and terrible.  I hope it's over quickly and without blood.  That sounds like a foolish thing but I'll say it anyway.</p>

<p>You say you'll be all right in the rear and I guess that's true.  I don't figure the post office is very high on their hit lists.  Just don't get cocky, you reckless little shit.  </p>

<p>Come home safe, come home soon.  Laugh if you want, but I'm actually praying.</p>
