<h1>Screwups</h1>

<p>They found a Mexican place that didn't really do Mexican food and sat over bowls of gazpacho and French bread, washed down with some good local beer.  "So," Madden said after they toasted old times, "how did you screw up?"</p>

<p>Harley peered at him from under the lowered brim of his porkpie hat.  "Jeez, Madden."</p>

<p>But he knew.  They both knew.  Running into each other here and now, the thought was unavoidable.  Each of them must have screwed up.  Otherwise Harley would be someplace like Baghdad or Amman, hazardous to his health but good for his career, and Madden would be pounding some real turf, Chicago or Miami, not cooling his butt in this sleepy little town.</p>

<p>"I told them I wouldn't go," Harley explained.</p>

<p>Madden looked at him.  "No shit?"</p>
