<h1>Which Dream</h1>

<p>Harley looked around the restaurant.  The lunch rush was over now and half the tables were still clean and empty.  </p>

<p>"It had to stop somewhere, I guess.  But you know me, Gerry, I've got this thing for the big trends.  I like to think about the impliations.  What happens to this society once the money dries up?  Okay, we have to face the real world.  But what happens to our dreams, huh?"</p>

<p>Madden snorted.  He had a zero clich√© tolerance.  "Shit, Harley, you stayed in TV way too long. Don't start with that 'American Dream' bullshit.  House and car and wife and kids and a word from our sponsors.  If you got any smarts at all you know that one broke down about 1974."  </p>

<p>"That wasn't the dream I was talking about."</p>
