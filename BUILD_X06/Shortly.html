<h1>Shortly</h1>

<p>"Now Dexter," the Sarge cautioned,  "don't please <i>don't</i>  start in with the paranoia, 'cause I am in no kind of goddam mood for it tonight."</p>

<p>Dexter shrugged and flipped his hood down.  He was the only one in the platoon who could actually sleep in a CBW suit.  But then again, Dexter was one of those lucky guys who could sneak a nap into just about any five minute interval.  The kind best advised never to work as long-distance busdrivers.</p>

<p>"Home," Emily was saying.  "<a class="textlink"  href="Because_Because_Because.html">Home home home</a>."</p>

<p>"Soon," the Whizzer added.  "Real real soon."</p>

<p>Dexter threw back his hood, snapped up out of sleep.  "Shut the fuck up!" he yelled.  "Don't you people know anything about short time?"</p>
