<h1>Retreat</h1>

<p>Using his provostial influence, Tate had claimed the old observatory as his personal keep.  The inside of the dome was now a strange hybrid, part working observatory, part private library.  On this level the floor was just a few yards wide, encircling a deep well sunk into the foundations to accommodate the mechanism of the telescope mount.  U looked at the big cylinder pointed up at the huge slotted opening in the ceiling.  The topmost weather panels were still rolled back.</p>

<p>"I've been watching some interesting things happen," Tate explained.  "It's been an exciting evening."</p>

<p>U walked over to the edge of the platform.  An iron railing and a plain wooden workbench ran around the well.  All through the cavernous room, nearly every inch of space on the bench was taken up by books, papers, charts, cases, computers, gadgets, general litter.</p>
