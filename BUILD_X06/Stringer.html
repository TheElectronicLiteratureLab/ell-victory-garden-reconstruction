<h1>Stringer</h1>

<p>They're both up and somehow Harley manages to get into the whole outfit — coat, tie <i>and</i>  the porkpie hat (useful in all kinds of contingencies) — before she's got her sweater untangled from the bedclothes.  More of those tricks of the trade.  He waits semi-patiently by the door, eyes on the <a class="textlink"  href="Feed.html">feed</a>.</p>

<p>Somehow they both know the plan without discussion.  Harley's officially on "stress leave" but quick study that she is, Veronica's learned that neither of those words mean anything when <a class="textlink"  href="Big_Story.html">History</a> dials your pager.  It's the birth of a stringer.</p>

<p>He's heading out to Cover the Story, whatever that may turn out to mean here in Tara.  He's thinking <i>a college town deep in the heart of the Sunbelt, this could get interesting</i>.  Veronica's telepathically adding <i>yeah and good luck without your trusty local guide to point you down the right streets</i>.</p>
