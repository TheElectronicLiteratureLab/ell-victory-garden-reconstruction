<h1>Point</h1>

<p>"Hold the sympathy," Dexter objected.  "There's a point to this story, right?"</p>

<p>"Is there?"</p>

<p>Dexter ignored him.  "It's like we're<i>all</i>  gonna end up in that chair sooner or later.  Everybody in America gets to be the Other Guy for fifteen minutes, or maybe longer.  Doesn't matter if you go out and ask for it like the Marines, or if you're just a support grunt like me and you, or maybe you're even a civilian.  Everybody gets his turn.  Think about it.  When this little rumble is over what do you think the fucking Arabs are gonna say — 'Oh wow, reamed again, but hey, that's the breaks, it's cool' —?  No fucking way, man.  They're gonna be out for blood."</p>
