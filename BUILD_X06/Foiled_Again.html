<p>Jude stared at the document in her hands.  It was a single sheet, laser printed, unsigned.  At the bottom of the page was a date, file name, and disposition line.  The extension on the filename was ".final" and the disposition line said it had been mailed earlier that day.</p>

<p>"What the hell is this?" Jude wondered.</p>
