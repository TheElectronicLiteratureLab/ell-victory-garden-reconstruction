<h1>Enigma</h1>

<p>Like any maze or enigma, Victory Garden will often bring you back to a place you've already been.  Sometimes these familiar moments will be followed by something new.  At other times you may find yourself in a loop, in which case you may want to invoke a yield-word.  If you hold down the Option and Command (ï£¿) keys, the <a class="textlink"  href="The_Place_of_Big_Wind.html">words that yield</a> will be identified.</p>

<p>You can also call up a list of all possible links leading out of a given moment by clicking on the Browse icon (the open book) on the bar below.</p>

<p>To end your reading, choose the File menu command.</p>
