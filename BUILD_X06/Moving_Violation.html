<h1>Moving Violation</h1>

<p>Harley was thinking about just going ahead and strangling the sonofabitch when he noticed a flicker of light reflecting off the dashboard.  Red, white, blue.  Kind of patriotic.</p>

<p>Harley took a look over his shoulder and his eyes went wide.  "Oh perfect."</p>

<p>"It's that sedan isn't it?" Urquhart said.  "I don't want to look."</p>

<p>Harley threw a hard right against Urquhart's forearm.  Which wasn't such a good idea, since it caused the car to lunge hard to the left, scrabbling and skidding along the shoulder.</p>

<p>"No, you crazy shithead, it's not any damned sedan.  It's a fucking police cruiser, and I think you better pull over right now."</p>
