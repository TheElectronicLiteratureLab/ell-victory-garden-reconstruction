<h1>Night</h1>

<p>"I haven't had a cigarette in three and a half weeks," she tells me.  We're sitting on the deck looking at <a class="textlink"  href="New.html">Venus</a> up there, brighter than any airliner.</p>

<p>I tell her that's wonderful, I'm truly jealous.  I've quit three times so far but can't manage to stay the course.  I ask her how she managed, where she found the strength, and she tells me it was probably the move: she feels renewed, made over into a different woman.  New attitudes, new memories.</p>

<p>"Do you miss <a class="textlink"  href="Aftermath.html">Tara</a>?" I ask again.</p>

<p>"Some," she tells me.  "The people, the food, the beer.  And maybe the cactus."</p>

<p>It's been more than a year, I observe, and she's never brought the subject up.  It's something she'd rather put behind her.</p>
