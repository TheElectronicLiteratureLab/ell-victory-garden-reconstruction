<h1>Troublesome Priests</h1>

<p>On the religion beat...</p>

<p>It seems that President Bush's overnight guest at the White House on this momentous occasion is <a class="textlink"  href="God_s_Comic.html">Billy Graham</a>, "reportedly a close friend of the President" (but when Brit Hume says that he seems so <i>skeptical</i>  ).</p>
