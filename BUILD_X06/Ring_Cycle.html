<h1>Ring Cycle</h1>

<p>Once more U ran through the dark field, slipping and scrambling on the dry ground.  He knew Madden was behind him somewhere but he did not look.</p>

<p>U crossed the parking lot and stumbled to the door of the observatory.  His ribs were still bruised and his mouth was bloody; his clothes were torn and in disarray.  None of this mattered, since U had almost no awareness of his physical state.  He was aware only of the idea that had seized him, the necessity.</p>

<p><i>The answer to everything.</i>  Now more than ever.</p>
<i>
</i><p>The double doors were locked but there was a pushbutton.  U pressed and waited.  Strange music came from inside: Billy Van Saxgutter singing songs of the Argentine pampas.  Through the frosted glass of the doors he could see a <a class="textlink"  href="On_2.html">light</a> approaching, moving up and down in phase with its bearer's gait.  Tate opened the door, shining his light in his visitor's eyes.</p>
