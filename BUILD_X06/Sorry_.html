<h1>Sorry...</h1>

<p>The lights up ahead proved to belong, as Harley truly hoped they wouldn't, to two more patrol cars hastily pulled hood-to-hood across the road.  Urquhart shifted down into fourth for better acceleration.  He showed no indication of stopping.</p>

<p>Well shit, Harley thought, phone Fitzmaurice and tell him he was right.  Guess I <i>should</i>  have gone to Bahrain.  The barricade was about two miles up the road now.  Urquhart was pushing the car over eighty, gripping the wheel with knotted fists.</p>

<p>Facing relatively certain death, Harley found himself momentarily capable of detachment.  "Okay, fine, so we're going to be killed," he conceded.  "Would you mind telling me why?"</p>

<p>Urquhart glanced over apologetically.  "Sorry.  There isn't time to explain."</p>

<p>"Fuck you."  So much for detachment.  "Fuck you, fuck you, fuck <i>you!"</i></p>
