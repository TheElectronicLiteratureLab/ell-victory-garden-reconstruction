<h1>On the Bus</h1>

<p>Jude had to wait until the giggles subsided.  "I'm sorry.  I'm not making fun, really.  I know what you're feeling, or at least I think I do.  It's just that you're being so ridiculous about it."</p>

<p>"Well gee thanks, Jude."</p>

<p>"No really.  I know all about this swarming sensation of yours.  Me, in only 25 years I've been through more selves than you could fit on a school bus."</p>

<p>"What do you know about insanity?"  Urquhart shook his head.</p>
