<h1>JSN</h1>

<p>Down at The Saloon of Tomorrow (more widely known, for reasons best kept obscure, as the Just Say No Caf√©), the mood was subdued.  Here it was  just past nine on a Thursday, and not just any old Thursday but either an Apocalypse Soon Open Mike Nite or a Stairway to Heaven Hoot Nite (cash prizes for the least recognizable rendition) depending on which of two barely legible chalkboards you regarded as authoritative, assuming you still wanted anything to do with a concept like authority in this day and age, <a class="textlink"  href="Acknowledged.html">ack</a>.  </p>
