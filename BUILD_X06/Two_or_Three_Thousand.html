<h1>Two or Three Thousand</h1>
<i>
<p>What letters?</p>

<p>Oh, the ones written in by alumni, students, and parents of service personnel in the Gulf.  The ones that point out that this is a time requiring national unity and a sense of common purpose.  The ones that urge Tate to reconsider curricular changes that divide the faculty, alienate the taxpayers, and place the University in the glare of national controversy.</p>

<p>How many of these letters are we talking about?</p>

<p>Oh, two or three thousand, max.</i>  </p>

<p>You had to hand it to him.  As ratfucking went, this was a genuine coup.</p>
