<h1>About the War</h1>

<p><i>But mainly he's been writing about the War,</i>  Veronica went on, the playfulness leaving her voice.</p>

<p>There was an awkward, expensive silence while the four of us tried to think of something to throw into the gap.  The War.  Strange to think of events barely a year in the past as such a definable event, as a moment in our history.  And yet, as we well knew, it had changed us all.  The War.</p>

<p><i>I hope it's going well, Harley</i>,  I finally said lamely.</p>
