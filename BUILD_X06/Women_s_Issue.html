<h1>Women's Issue</h1>
<tt>
<p>Then there's the women's issue, and don't try to laugh that one off, little sister.  It's less of a laughing matter every day now, what with Bush packing the Court and the rightwingers howling a little louder at each full moon.</p>

<p>This is something I can't understand about you, Emily â€” why you're so eager to dress up like a soldier and play their <a class="textlink"  href="Suit_You_.html">boyscout</a> games.  I'm a tough old workingclass broad myself, I can understand that you like the job.  Maybe I'm jealous of that.  There are lots of times when I want to hang up this academic bullshit and do some honest sweaty nine-to-five.</p>

<p>But you're not just on the line, honey, you're on the Team, and that's what I don't get.  You don't just work for Uncle, you Serve.  You took that oath, and you took it seriously.  Part of me says good for you, there's not nearly enough honesty and commitment around these days.  Part of me also thinks you're a sellout and a betrayer.</p>
