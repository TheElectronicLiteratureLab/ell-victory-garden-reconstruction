<h1>Our Heroes</h1>

<p>Most of the choices were predictable — several hundred showed up as Elvis, Madonna, Axl Rose, or Jesus; or as unspecified punks, metalheads, pro wrestlers, ninja turtles.  Others were more interesting: a Barbara Jordan, a Mitch Snyder, and the rugby team who came as Christa McAuliffe.  Nor should we forget that dedicated group who arrived in black tights and sandwich boards bearing the names of great women whose faces we don't know (Jane Adams, Amelia Earhart, Barbara McClintock, int. al.).</p>

<p>But as you might expect, given the geopolitics of this Hallowe'en, the night really belonged to Heroes of the Desert.  </p>

<p>There were variations on the basic concept — several impersonations of TV's Rat Patrol, including one couple done up as the jeeps, about a dozen Lawrences of Arabia (and those cries of "No prisoners!" got old <i>real</i>  fast), a handful of Pattons and a Rommel.  Still, most folks had their minds on the Gulf.  The <a class="textlink"  href="Pump_It_Up.html">Stormin' Norman look</a> seemed<i>de rigueur</i>  for faculty in Engineering, but mostly what you had was Grunts.</p>
