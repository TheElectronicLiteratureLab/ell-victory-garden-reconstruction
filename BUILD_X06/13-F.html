<p>And now here you are inserted into your allotted bodyspace, 13-F among the other galley slaves.  You are deep in the belly of the beast and the flighties are bringing you beer and peanuts and textured eatstuff but what you really want right now is your valium drip because here is the voice of the Captain and it say <i>Folks, how much do you know about the everyday phenomenon called Turbulence?
