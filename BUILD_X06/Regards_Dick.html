<h1>Regards Dick</h1>

<p>On February 10, 1991, Secretary of Defense <a class="textlink"  href="National_Dick.html">Dick</a> Cheney is winding up a tour of the Gulf.  During a photo opportunity he autographs a 2,000-pound <a class="textlink"  href="Fill_The_Pool.html">laser-guided bomb</a>. Dear Baghdad This Bud's For You, Regards Dick Cheney.  Something like that.</p>

<p>On February 14, 1991, first reports of the Al Amiriya shelter bombing appear in the western press.  U.S. Stealth fighters made two direct hits on what the Pentagon still insists was a reinforced military command-and-control bunker.  Between three and four hundred Iraqi civilians, mostly women and children, were killed in the attack.</p>

<p>The ordnance used against the Al Amiriya bomb shelter was a 2,000-pound GBU-27 laser-guided "smart" bomb.</p>

<p>Of <i>course</i>  it wasn't the one that Cheney personally endorsed.</p>
