<h1>Freak Whence He</h1>

<p>I don't know, maybe I was just behind the door when the Rational Explanation was given out, but so far as I recall the incident is still unsolved.  Some loony runs up to <a class="textlink"  href="Cronkite.html">Rather</a> on the steps of his Manhattan brownstone, starts pounding on his face, yelling, "What's the Frequency, Kenneth?"</p>

<p>A question that grows more interesting as you try to build it a context.  What exactly is <i>the frequency</i>  of moments like that one, spots when the Fabric wears a little too thin and the lunacy seeps through, giving us <a class="textlink"  href="Here_s_Another_Hint.html">a forbidden glimpse of Mother Chaos</a> beneath?</p>

<p><i>How often</i>  can we expect these intimations?  And what if the frequency should change... if it should increase?<i> </i> </p>

<p>What's it mean when we start to get these little hints <i>all the time?</i> <i> </i></p>
