<h1>Victor</h1>

<p>"Then one night in April I went to a birthday party for this guy named Victor.  I've known him for years.  We used to go out for a while, but we were both getting over bad relationships so it stayed casual."</p>

<p>"Victor.  What's he like?"</p>

<p>Emily drew her knees up.  "Nice enough.  Tall and skinny, kind of athletic without being a jock.  He has great moves.  For an ordinary white boy from West Tara, he's a real fine dancer."  She stopped and smiled.  "And lemme tell you, what an ass."</p>

<p>"Sweet cheeks."</p>

<p>"The sweetest."</p>

<p>"Well I'm glad you've got taste."</p>
