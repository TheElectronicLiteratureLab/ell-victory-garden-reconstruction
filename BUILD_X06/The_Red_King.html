<h1>The Red King</h1>

<p>Macarthur stretched and scratched the back of his neck.  He had the vague impression that he'd just listened to a long and somewhat overwritten piece of music though now he couldn't recall a single note.  His left arm was all pins and needles.</p>

<p>He wondered how the demo had gone.  The video link to the seminar room was two-way but when he looked at his own screen all he could see were <a class="textlink"  href="Halftones.html">shadows on shadows</a>.</p>

<p>Oh well.</p>
