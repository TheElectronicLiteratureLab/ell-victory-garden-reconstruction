<h1>1963 Facts</h1>

<p>Threading back through memory's labyrinth, Urquhart recalled an earlier turn in the road, another moment of strange arrival.  Here were Mrs. Urquhart and her six-year-old son walking past the local draft board and all of a sudden it was time to hear about the American facts of life.  </p>

<p>In Fact, life came tangled in mortal conditions and obligations.  These were of two varieties, one proper to each sex.  For women, the pain and jeopardy of childbearing; for men, the readiness to fight and die in defense of the nation.  As Mrs. Urquhart's experience so far included the Second World War and a couple of serious tries at a Third, she was inclined to take this obligation seriously.</p>
