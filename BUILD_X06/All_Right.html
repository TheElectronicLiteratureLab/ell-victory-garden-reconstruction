<h1>All Right</h1>

<p>Emily walks into the townhouse and the first thing she sees standing there in the middle of the living room — in fact taking up <i>most</i>  of the living room — is this truly humongous brass-railed fourposter bed.  Nine-by-six floral-canopied hypertrophied Victoriana.  All the other furniture in the room seems to have fled into the corners.</p>

<p>"What is this, Laura Ashley's set for Wrestlemania?"</p>

<p>"I woke up one morning and it had moved in," Boris tries to explain.  "I'm afraid to go near it."</p>
