<h1>Not So Safe</h1>

<p>OPEN THE DOORS VERY SLOWLY AND GET OUT OF THE CAR.  KEEP YOUR HANDS ABOVE YOUR HEADS.</p>

<p>Urquhart's head was reeling again.  What was he doing here at rest?  He needed to be in motion.  The lights were glaring, blinding him.</p>

<p>Harley eased his car door open using extreme care.  "Come on, Boris old buddy.  Everything's gonna be fine.  Let's just do it like they say."</p>

<p>Urquhart couldn't understand what was happening.  He couldn't see what was going on.  There was too much light.  He was able to make out only a small patch of their surroundings.  Everything else was flooded in glare.</p>

<p>YOU IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT.  ROLL DOWN YOUR WINDOW AND PUT YOUR HANDS ON THE DOOR.</p>
