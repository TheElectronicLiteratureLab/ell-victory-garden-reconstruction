<h1>What Do I Say?</h1>

<p>All the letters from home.  It is important what you're doing, keeping the links together, reminding them that it all connects.  If war has become, has always been, a game of information, then what you do...</p>

<p>Emily my only hope against time.</p>

<p>Come back.</p>
