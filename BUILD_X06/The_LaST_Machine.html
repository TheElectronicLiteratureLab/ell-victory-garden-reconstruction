<p>— Here it is, Tate announces, the mighty SCAMD itself.</p>

<p>It sits there paradoxically, the ultimate black box.</p>

<p>You see a metal enclosure, approximately fifteen centimeters by ten by three.  There are no visible power leads.  There are no connection points, junctions, sockets, or terminals.  The casing shows no vents or openings of any kind.  It doesn't even appear to have<i>seams</i> .  There are no lights, no switches, no keyboards, monitors, or cables.</p>

<p>— Ingenious, you say, but uh, what does one do about input?  To say nothing of output?</p>

<p>Tate grins his mischievous grin and claps you cheerily on the shoulders. — Oh, not to worry, <a class="textlink"  href="P_C_.html">we'll think of something</a>.  </p>

<p>Besides, you only have to connect with it <a class="textlink"  href="In_the_Beginning.html">once</a>...</p>
