<h1>Lucy Reasons</h1>

<p>Sometimes Lucy was <a class="textlink"  href="Ringing_Tone.html">a voice on the telephone</a> as well as in her head, and Veronica knew she would be calling soon.  The call would come partly out of <a class="textlink"  href="I_m_OK.html">concern</a> about Emily and the war, but there would be Lucy reasons as well.  </p>

<p>Lucy reasons, like Thea's politics, had to do with <a class="textlink"  href="Face_the_Wall.html">plots and big stories</a>.  People of this generation seemed to need big stories to hold their lives together, to orient themselves.  Lucy had gone through a number of these stories in the time Veronica had known her.  </p>

<p>Lately she was less concerned with the stories themselves than with the way they all <a class="textlink"  href="A_New_Refutation_of_Time.html">ended</a>.</p>
