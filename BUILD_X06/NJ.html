<h1>NJ</h1>

<p><i>So where are you guys anyway?  </i> I asked.</p>

<p><i>Camden, New Jersey,</i>  Harley told me.  <i>It's a fine place to be if you're curious about what life must have been like in the Depression.</p>

<p>Camden?</i>  Thea said, <i>Does that mean you're back in school, Veronica? </p>

<p>Sure does.  I'm in the Women's Studies program right now, though I'm thinking I might go for a master's in Social Work...</p>

<p>Way to go, </i> Thea told her.  <i>I'm proud of you, kiddo.</p>

<p>And Harley's been writing,</i>  Veronica added.</p>
