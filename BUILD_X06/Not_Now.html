<h1>Not Now</h1>

<p>Harley traces a finger down the overhang of her upmost breast and wonders if what he's feeling here could be the opposite of an out-of-body experience.  He hears this voice that sounds uncomfortably like <a class="textlink"  href="Story_of_Your_Career.html">Fitzmaurice</a>: <i>Give it up, Harley, we know you're in there </i>.  And then a second voice played by his all-time favorite, James Earl Jones, shouting: <i>No way you miserable swine â€” you'll  just have to blast me out! </i></p>

<p>Sad to say, this is what happens.</p>

<p>CNN comes on with a bulletin.  Veronica's been giving the tube no attention but still she knows the instant it breaks because Harley's breath catches and his pulse spikes radically.</p>

<p>Flashes of light, they're saying.  Reports of gunfire in and around <a class="textlink"  href="Ground_Zero.html">Baghdad</a>.</p>

<p>Stand by.</p>
