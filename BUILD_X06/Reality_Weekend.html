<h1>Reality Weekend</h1>

<p>Dexter took another swig from his water ration and carried on.  </p>

<p>"Before I shipped out, me and some friends decided to have this <a class="textlink"  href="Rainbow.html">Reality Weekend</a>.  We got real fucked up and went down to the cineplex, spent the whole day sneaking from one theatre to the next.  We started at noon and didn't get home till one in the morning.  There was nine movies and I think we saw four or five all the way through.  We saw bits of the other ones too."</p>

<p>"Oh<i>mercy</i>   not another one of your goddamned stories."</p>

<p>Dexter tossed him the water bottle.  "I think we saw <i>Darkman</i>  and the end of <i>Batman </i>, or maybe it was the other way around, anyway it all runs together.  The point is both those movies have the same scene in them."</p>

<p>"On Reality Weekend, every fucking movie has the same scene in it."</p>
