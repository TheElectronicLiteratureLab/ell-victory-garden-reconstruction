<h1>The Seventies</h1>

<p>Jude laughed in a way she meant as friendly.  "I'm sorry, Dr. U.  Really, no offense.  So you're having a little trouble holding yourself together these days.  It happens.  What was it, too much Liquid Sunshine back in the sixties?"</p>

<p>"It was the seventies," he pointed out, "and back then I wasn't having any.  I was an abstaining geek."  He gave it some thought.  "Maybe that's the problem."</p>

<p>Jude traced some stylized paisleys with her cigar end.  "Vitamin Acid never did me all that much good," she reflected.  "But maybe you're right.  If you'd done some tripping, maybe you wouldn't be so concerned about what's going on in your head now."</p>

<p>"I'm losing my sanity, Jude."</p>

<p>"Oh, that."  As if he'd said he was losing his hair.</p>
