<h1>The Watchtower</h1>
<p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^</p>
<p>You are standing on the watchtower, which seems to extend considerably beyond the Earth's atmosphere.  The curvature of the planet is clearly visible.  <a class="textlink"  href="National_Dick.html">The watchman</a> is standing on his spar, smearing his thinning locks with lamb fat.</p>

<p>"Ã–e," you say.  "What's the meaning of this."</p>

<p>The watchman regards you.  He is kind of dark and <a class="textlink"  href="Face_It.html">Sicilian-Sephardic-looking</a>, sort of a cross between <a class="textlink"  href="National_Dick.html">Richard Nixon</a> and <a class="textlink"  href="TV_as_Radio.html">Neil Postman</a>.  His little pigseyes catch you in their gaze.</p>

<p>"Well.  You're no angel."</p>

<p>"But I wanna <a class="textlink"  href="Slacktown.html">get to heaven</a> just the same."</p>
