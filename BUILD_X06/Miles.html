<h1>Miles</h1>

<p>Thea's friend Miles Macarthur drives in from Las Vegas for a conference and screening.  In some unaccountable way he's suddenly turned into a filmmaker and he's spent the last year producing a documentary about a group of <a class="textlink"  href="Rock_of_Faith.html">apocalyptic Christians</a> who seem to have an obsession with Hollywood disaster epics.  Miles has been invited to screen it for a "Film on Film" conference.  That's appropriate, since most of Miles' footage shows people watching other movies.  Apparently Miles' film is very much admired for its technique.</p>

<p>I like Miles â€” it seems impossible not to.  There's something <a class="textlink"  href="Coming_In_.html">gentle and dignified</a> about him.  He's got that Jesuit strain injected crosswise, but in his case it's produced something very rare, a sort of saintly cynicism.</p>

<p>Apparently Miles was a close friend of <a class="textlink"  href="On_2.html">poor Urquhart</a>, which is how Thea met him.  Tara is with us always.</p>
