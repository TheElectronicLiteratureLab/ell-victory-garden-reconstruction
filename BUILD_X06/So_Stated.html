<h1>So Stated</h1>

<p>U considered.  "A statement?" he ventured.</p>

<p>Madden reached his right hand into his coat.  Holy shit, U said to himself and hit the deck hard.  Madden came out with his ballpoint and Papermate.  Click.  "Statement, yeah?"</p>

<p>U blinked back at him from behind the cover of an old PC.</p>

<p>"Go ahead," said Madden.  "You should pardon the expression, but shoot."</p>

<p>"Peace now," U told him.  "Liberty and justice for all."</p>

<p>Madden stowed the pen and paper, shrugging.  "It's kind of a tall order, but we'll do our best."  He turned and walked to the door.</p>
