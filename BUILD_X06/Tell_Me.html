<h1>Tell Me</h1>

<p>"I can't do it," Victor protested.</p>

<p>Jude straddled him, hiking the loose skirt far up her thighs.  He could feel her mons against the crotch of his jeans. He could feel the heat of her.  And now she was leaning over, covering him, kissing lightly along his jaw and around his lips.  The tips of her breasts grazed his chest.</p>

<p>"Tell me how her skin smelled."</p>

<p>"Jude."</p>

<p>"Tell me."  She unbuttoned her dress to the waist and slipped it off her shoulders, pulling her arms free.  She ran a white nail around the aureole of her left breast.  The nipple stood out, dark and firm.  He felt a little shiver run through her thighs.</p>
