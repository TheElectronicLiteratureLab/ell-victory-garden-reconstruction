<p>Though you never comprehend the words, you come to know somehow that the P.A. announcement is an instruction to gather.  All the families must gather up what belongs to them and join an orderly procession headed down the street or up the hill or over the bridge or across the river to the gathering place.  There they must go into the auditorium and take their appointed seats, where they will wait for the dream to be over.</p>
