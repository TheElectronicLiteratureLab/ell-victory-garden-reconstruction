<h1>Shooters</h1>

<p>"It's sheer chaos around here," Tate allowed.  "Frankly, I work better under these conditions."  </p>

<p>U walked idly around the room, riffling pages and glancing at spines.  He came across titles in astronautics, economics, military science, cybernetics.  There were also loose papers, phonograph records, printouts, the occasional thing in a jar.  At one point U found an old framed photograph propped against the railing.  It looked like a group shot of some depression-era gunsels.  Hijackers, numbers runners, pimps, that sort.  The men wore suits with broad lapels and stared at the camera with a sort of absentminded nastiness.  U expected shoes with spats.  The central figure was a round-faced fellow with his hair parted down the middle.  His right arm was wired into a big sloppy cast, looking like it was stuck halfway in a Fascist salute.</p>

<p>"<a class="textlink"  href="Relic.html">Memento</a>," Tate said, seeing him with the picture.  "Old friends from the war.  Know any of them?"  U put the picture back on the counter; he didn't know them.</p>
