<h1>Special Occasion</h1>

<p>"Besides," Billy Van went on, accepting a cold one from Vance, Sigma Omega's entertainment coordinator, "th' way Ah reckon, tonight is a purty special occasion."</p>

<p>Billy Van leaned out the window to tip his Stetson at a passing pickup wearing <a class="textlink"  href="No_Excuses.html">three<i> </i>yellow ribbons</a> on its CB aerial.  This time Vance took hold of the wheel before anything untoward happened.</p>

<p>He resumed his seat.  "Ah mean, ain't ever' night o' the year that a gawd-bless√©d shootin'<i> </i>war starts up."</p>

<p>"Fuckin' A."</p>
