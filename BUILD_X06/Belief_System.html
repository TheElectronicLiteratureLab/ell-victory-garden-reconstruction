<h1>Belief System</h1>

<p>"What about you, Roy?" Thea asked him as he towelled off.  "Have you found some <a class="textlink"  href="On_the_Road.html">bullshit to believe in</a> yet, or doesn't that come along with puberty anymore?"</p>

<p>He gave her a protesting look and tried to cover as much of himself as possible with the towel.  Which at six-one wasn't easy.  "Actually I'm glad you asked me that question, Ma.  I've been meaning to have this talk with you."</p>

<p>"I presume you don't mean about eggs and sperms and masturbation."</p>

<p>"Nah.  I mean the one about <a class="textlink"  href="What_Should_I_Do_.html">blood and oil</a> and demonstrations."</p>

<p>"Oh goody.  Just my kind of B.S."</p>

<p>"Yeah but <a class="textlink"  href="Remember_Your_Roots.html">hear me out</a>, okay?"</p>
