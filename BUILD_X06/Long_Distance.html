<h1>Long Distance</h1>

<p><i>So how's things out there in lotusland?  Are you still whale watching? </p>

<p>Things are swell here, Harley.  Jeez it's good to hear your voice.  Hang on a sec, here's Thea.</i></p>

<p>She was awake now and picking up on the living room extension.  <i>Harley, you no-account rat bastard, why haven't I heard from you in six months? </p>

<p>Hey sweetheart.  Always the same Thea.  We've been travelling, don't you know.  'On the road,' as that talented son of yours likes to say...</p>

</i><p>Thea sighed.  <i>Don't tell me you've had a visit from Leroy, too.  He seems to've used up all his father's friends and now he's making the rounds of mine.</i></p>
