<h1>Targetting</h1>

<p><u>ARNETT</u>:  <i>...they all have their targets and we hope that one of them is not the Al Rashid Hotel.</p>
</i>
<p>A pertinent concern ...</p>

<p><u>SHAW</u>:  <i>Gentlemen, does it occur to you that <a class="textlink"  href="_Para_No_.html">it is not accidental</a> that we are still reporting to the world?</i></p>

<p>In a few days, Reed Irvine, founder of <a class="textlink"  href="Solid_Foundation.html">Accuracy in Media</a>, will be urging government action to suspend Arnett's broadcasts from Baghdad.  </p>

<p>Truth, Irvine argues, is the most dangerous form of propaganda.</p>
