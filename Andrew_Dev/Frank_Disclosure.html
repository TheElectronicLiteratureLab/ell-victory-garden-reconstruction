<p>"Your father, Franklin D. Sieger," Thea told the boy, "was a founding member of SDS at Berkeley, did you know that?"</p>

<p>"Students, not Strategic.  Another century."  She saw it click: oh, the<em>sixties</em> , right.  "Think of Michael Stipe with real politics."</p>

<p>Leroy worked on that one.  "You mean Dad used to be a liberal?"</p>

<p>"Once upon a time," she said, "your daddy thought of himself as an anarchist.  But he was wrong.  He was only an asshole."</p>
