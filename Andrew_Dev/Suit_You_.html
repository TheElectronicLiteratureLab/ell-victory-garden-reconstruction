<h1>Suit You?</h1>
<tt>
<p>I am scared for you, Emily.  We're all targets these days, it's true.  I'm up in the air a lot these days, it could be me and not you, who knows.  Still somehow I feel that you're sitting at the worst kind of bullseye — there in the thick of it but not at the front, like those poor bastards in Beirut.  God I hope I'm wrong about that.  Watch your ass and come home safe.  I may not agree with you but I do love you, kiddo.</p>

<p>What scares me more, though, isn't really the bombs or guns or gas.  As you've said, it's the <a class="textlink"  href="Hopeless.html">changes</a>: and what scares me most is the thought of <u>you</u> changing.</p>

<p>What will you be like when we all see you again?  Same old Emily? — why do I doubt that?  What scares me is that you've made your separate peace, you've found a way to get along in the game.</p>

<p>I keep seeing you coming down the airplane ramp wearing some kind of gray worsted business suit.  Don't laugh.</p>
