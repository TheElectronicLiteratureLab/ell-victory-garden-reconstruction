<p>This Information Kiosk looks kind of odd because it's wearing a dark suit and a yarmulke.  But then again it also looks familiar, in fact it looks a lot like Rabbi Berman who used to live down the street from you in Park Slope.</p>

<p>You used to talk with him all the time about metaphysics and the 
<a class="textlink"  href="In_Control.html">theology of airplane crashes</a>.</p>

<p>The Kiosk smiles because it sees that you remember. </p>

<p>— Once upon a time, it says in its synthesized voice, somebody told me a story.  But this is not that story, this is another one.  It is called "The Rabbi's Gift."
