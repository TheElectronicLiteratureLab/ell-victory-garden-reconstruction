<h1>Miles in Nature</h1>

<p>"This is, like, <em>nature</em> ," Miles said, sniffing.  He was somewhere past diffident and headed straight for wary.  </p>

<p>"It's some kind of lovely," Harley said, looking out over all that sparkling water.</p>

<p>"Nature is, like,<em>wet</em> ," Miles observed, dipping in part of a toe.  "It could get all over you."</p>

<p>"That's the concept," Thea told him.</p>

<p>Veronica loped around to the deep end and took a quick plunge, body-conscious and anxious to avoid display â€” though of course the pale flash of her dive turned heads all along the line of sight.  All except for Thea, who <a class="textlink"  href="Ancient_History.html">looked away</a>.  She toyed with her bowling shirt, summoned her gumption, shucked it off and made an elegant entry, slipping in with barely a ripple.  Harley pinched his nostrils and followed feet-first.</p>
