<h1>Public Opinion</h1>

<p>By now the rumblings from halfway round the world had grown into an unavoidable topic of conversation.  Veronica kept running up against it.</p>

<p>"End of the world as we know it," a white boy in dreadlocks was saying in the living room.  "Saddam lets all that shit loose in the oilfields, you won't be able to stand downwind for a couple decades.  How's that for an energy policy?"</p>

<p>Veronica started to say something but reeled off into futility.</p>

<p>"Fuck that protest scene," a restless drummer declared in the back bedroom.  His group was going through a court-ordered disbandment and he was kind of stressed.  "If you ask me, a nice little war is just what this fucking town needs.  Give it a crash dose of reality, shock some sense into these <a class="textlink"  href="Critics.html">slackers</a>."  Veronica found the <a class="textlink"  href="Into_the_Country.html">bean dip</a> at the drummer's feet and spent an interesting minute or two slathering it over his facial parts.</p>
