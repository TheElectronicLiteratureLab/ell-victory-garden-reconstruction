<p>"Okay," Thea granted.   "I'll stop questioning your commitment.  So let's talk strategy â€” what do you think our chances are?"</p>

<p>Urquhart reflected.  "Well I doubt they'll actually lynch us.  Tar and festschrift maybe."</p>

<p>"Be serious, Boris.  We have the upper hand here.  We're the duly authorized committee.  We're the ones appointed by the Dean and Faculty.
