<h1>No Resistance</h1>
<tt>
<p>I thought you were wrong to go, Emily, and I still do.  Yet I never told you that.  I never asked if you'd considered <a class="textlink"  href="Otherness.html">resisting</a>.  I never told you what your options were, I never told you I'd back you up if you decided to refuse the orders.</p>

<p>Why was that?  I must have talked to a half dozen students worried about the callups, men and women who said they weren't sure they ought to go.  I explained it all to them, I got them in touch with the people who could really help.  </p>

<p>But you never sounded unsure, kiddo.  You were sure.  Get the job done, you say.  Do your bit and come home.  When you said that, I guess I just looked into your eyes and decided it was your way, let it be.</p>

<p>Why didn't I try to change your mind?  Why was I content to let you go?  Why is it so hard to resist?  If there's a moral failure here, it's as much mine as yours, Emily â€” maybe more so.  I just don't know.  </p>
