<h1>Slippery</h1>

<p>Urquhart was bent over against the trunk of a patrol car listening to one of the arresting officers pulling out his handcuffs.  The cops seemed tense all of a sudden, apprehensive.  They were shoving Harley toward another car.  He was kicking and swearing and dodging.</p>

<p>Urquhart turned his head to the left.  There was the observatory, no more than two or three hundred yards across an open field.  He only needed to get free.  He heard a car approaching from the east, travelling pretty fast from the sound of it.</p>

<p>"Get him in the car and let's get the hell out of here," someone told the cop behind Urquhart.  He felt the cuffs land on his wrist but before the cop could snap them shut he bucked back fiercely, knocking the back of his skull against his captor's forehead.  Urquhart turned and made for the side of the road.</p>

<p>Someone said, "Oh Jesus what now?"  Several shots were fired.</p>
