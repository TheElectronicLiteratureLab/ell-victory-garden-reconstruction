<h1>We Can Work It Out</h1>

<p>"I'm talking about a systematic application of Master Johdan's vision.  Think about it, Boris.  A vast simulation embracing all aspects of economic activity, a gigantic competitive structure with hundreds of millions of players — or are they workers? — who would in fact derive their livelihood from subsidies paid out according to their performance in the game.  A game involving technologies, politics, laws, regulations, ideas, trends, fashions, philosophies, belief systems.  I'm talking about greatest imaginative endeavor in human history."</p>

<p>U stroked his hand slowly over Master Johdan's withered page.  "Where have I heard this before?"</p>

<p>Tate made a dismissive face.  "It was all speculation then.  But Boris, with these new technologies of yours, with virtual realities and cybernetic spaces and my Lord, now even interactive dreams, we can make this vision a reality.  We can create a system, Boris.  We can make it work."</p>
